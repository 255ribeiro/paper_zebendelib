abstract = {Graphs naturally appear in numerous application domains, ranging from social analysis, bioinformatics to computer vision. The unique capability of graphs enables capturing the structural relations among data, and thus allows to harvest more insights compared to analyzing data in isolation. However, it is often very challenging to solve the learning problems on graphs, because (1) many types of data are not originally structured as graphs, such as images and text data, and (2) for graph-structured data, the underlying connectivity patterns are often complex and diverse. On the other hand, the representation learning has achieved great successes in many areas. Thereby, a potential solution is to learn the representation of graphs in a low-dimensional Euclidean space, such that the graph properties can be preserved. Although tremendous efforts have been made to address the graph representation learning problem, many of them still suffer from their shallow learning mechanisms. Deep learning models on graphs (e.g., graph neural networks) have recently emerged in machine learning and other related areas, and demonstrated the superior performance in various problems. In this survey, despite numerous types of graph neural networks, we conduct a comprehensive review specifically on the emerging field of graph convolutional networks, which is one of the most prominent graph deep learning models. First, we group the existing graph convolutional network models into two categories based on the types of convolutions and highlight some graph convolutional network models in details. Then, we categorize different graph convolutional networks according to the areas of their applications. Finally, we present several open challenges in this area and discuss potential directions for future research.},

@article{Sonmez2007,
abstract = {The goal of this study is to obtain globally optimum shapes for two-dimensional structures subject to quasi-static loads and restraints. For this purpose a technique is proposed, using which the volume (or weight) of a structure can be minimized. The emphasis is on how one can define the shape precisely, and find a shape that accurately reflects the globally optimum shape. As design constraints, stresses developed in the structure should not exceed the maximum allowable stress, and connectivity of the structure should not be lost during shape changes. Optimization is achieved by a stochastic search algorithm called direct simulated annealing (DSA), which seeks the global minimum through randomly generated configurations. In order to obtain random configurations, a boundary variation technique is used. In this technique, a set of key points is chosen and connected by cubic splines to describe the boundary of the structure. Whenever the positions of the key points are changed in random directions, a new shape is obtained. Thus, coordinates of the key points serve as design variables. In order to apply the optimization procedure, a general computer code was developed using ANSYS Parametric Design Language. A number of cases were examined to test its effectiveness. The results show that this technique can be applied to two-dimensional shape optimization problems with high reliability even for cases where the entire free boundary is allowed to vary. ?? 2007 Elsevier B.V.

@phdthesis{ddaves2013,
abstract = {In this thesis I consider the relationship between the design of software and the design of flexible parametric models. There is growing evidence that parametric models employed in practice lack the flexibility to accommodate certain design changes. When a designer attempts to change a model's geometry (by modifying the model's underlying functions and parameters) they occasionally end up breaking the model. The designer is then left with a dilemma: spend time building a new model, or abandon the changes and revise the old model. Similar dilemmas exist in software engineering. Despite these shared concerns, Robert Woodbury (2010, 66) states that there is currently “little explicit connection” between the practice of software engineering and the practice of parametric modelling. In this thesis I consider, using a reflective practice methodology, how software engineering may inform parametric modelling. Across three case studies I take aspects of the software engineering body of knowledge (language paradigms; structured programming; and interactive programming) and apply them to the design of parametric models for the Sagrada Fam{\'{i}}lia, the Dermoid pavilion, and the Responsive Acoustic Surface. In doing so I establish three new parametric modelling methods. The contribution of this research is to show there are connections between the practice of software engineering and the practice of parametric modelling. These include the following: • Shared challenges: Both practices involve unexpected changes occurring within the rigid logic of computation. • Shared research methods: Research methods from software engineering apply to the study of parametric modelling. • Shared practices: The software engineering body of knowledge seems to offer a proven pathway for improving the practice of parametric modelling. These connections signal that software engineering is an underrepresented and important precedent for architects using parametric models; a finding that has implications for how parametric modelling is taught, how parametric models are integrated with practice, and for how researchers study and discuss parametric modelling.},

@article{An2021,
abstract = {In this study, a novel spatiotemporal graph convolutional networks model is proposed for traffic flow prediction in urban road networks by fully considering an information geometry approach and attention-based mechanism. Accurate traffic flow prediction in real urban road networks is challenging due to the presence of dynamic spatiotemporal data and external factors in the urban environment. Moreover, the dynamic spatial and temporal dependencies of urban traffic flow data are very important for predicting traffic flow, and it has been shown that a recent attention mechanism has a relatively good ability to capture these dynamic dependencies, which are not fully considered by most existing algorithms. Therefore, in the novel model abbreviated as IGAGCN, the information geometry method is utilized to determine the dynamic data distribution difference between different sensors. The attention mechanism is employed with the information geometry method, in which a matrix is derived by analyzing the distributions of sensor data, and the spatiotemporal dynamic connections in traffic flow data features are better at capturing the spatial dependencies of traffic between different sensors in urban road networks. Furthermore, a parallel sub-model architecture is proposed to consider long time spans, where each dilated causal convolution sub-model is applied to short time spans. Two well-known data sets were employed to demonstrate that our proposed method obtains better performance and is better at capturing the dynamic spatial dependencies of traffic than the existing only-attention-based models. In addition a real-world urban road network in Shenzhen, China, was studied to test and verify the proposed model.},

Previous applications of cellular automata to architectural design have oftentimes been characterised by their limited generative capacity for top–down developmental control and for pragmatic rule-breaking as they are easily offered by human designers. This paper explores different options for modifying and extending classical cellular automata systems to support architectural form finding. It discusses the potential of cellular automata as generative design tools with respect to the questions: In which part of a design development, during which periods during a design process and in what roles do cellular automata promise desirable results from a practical standpoint? In response to these questions, a theoretical framework for the integration of cellular automata into the design process is presented. An implementation of a dialogue-based cellular automata-supported design process model is outlined and evaluated by remodelling an existing architectural design project.},

abstract = {The transport literature is dense regarding short-term traffic predictions, up to the scale of 1 hour, yet less dense for long-term traffic predictions. The transport literature is also sparse when it comes to city-scale traffic predictions, mainly because of low data availability. In this work, we report an effort to investigate whether deep learning models can be useful for the long-term large-scale traffic prediction task, while focusing on the scalability of the models. We investigate a city-scale traffic dataset with 14 weeks of speed observations collected every 15 minutes over 1098 segments in the hypercenter of Los Angeles, California. We look at a variety of state-of-the-art machine learning and deep learning predictors for link-based predictions, and investigate how such predictors can scale up to larger areas with clustering, and graph convolutional approaches. We discuss that modelling temporal and spatial features into deep learning predictors can be helpful for long-term predictions, while simpler, not deep learning-based predictors, achieve very satisfactory performance for link-based and short-term forecasting. The trade-off is discussed not only in terms of prediction accuracy vs prediction horizon but also in terms of training time and model sizing.},

abstract = {The objective of the present work was to integrate the urban sustainability indicators by multicriteria approach using Commitment Programming (CP), which is based on Pressure-State-Response model, aiming to evaluate the intervention potential of socioeconomic, environmental and politics factors into the urbanization process. Such approach was applied to the north-northwest region of Campinas, SP, city by using Pressure (land use, urban growth and population density), State (green areas, urban equipment and social vulnerability) and Response (zoning plan 2004 and zoning plan 2018) components for modeling in GIS applying CP multicriteria method. It was observed that ∼49% of the analyzed area had a good indicative of sustainability, which was reduced till ∼29% with the implementation of the 2018 zoning plan. The exclusion of conservation areas is probably the determining factor for this reduction, as evidenced by pressure indicators on the Mata de Santa Genebra conservation unit and dendritic growth in the periurban areas. However, it should be noted that the evaluation encompassed the initial stage of zoning plan 2018, and a conclusive analysis of the environmental changes from the development was premature. Thus, it is recommended that this sustainability evaluation be a permanent tool to the analysis the actions of planning and management of urban land use.},

abstract = {Although reliability-based structural optimization (RBSO) is recognized as a rational structural design philosophy that is more advantageous to deterministic optimization, most common RBSO is based on straightforward two-level approach connecting algorithms of reliability calculation and that of design optimization. This is achieved usually with an outer loop for optimization of design variables and an inner loop for reliability analysis. A number of algorithms have been proposed to reduce the computational cost of such optimizations, such as performance measure approach, semi-infinite programming, and mono-level approach. Herein the sequential approximate programming approach, which is well known in structural optimization, is extended as an efficient methodology to solve RBSO problems. In this approach, the optimum design is obtained by solving a sequence of sub-programming problems that usually consist of an approximate objective function subjected to a set of approximate constraint functions. In each sub-programming, rather than direct Taylor expansion of reliability constraints, a new formulation is introduced for approximate reliability constraints at the current design point and its linearization. The approximate reliability index and its sensitivity are obtained from a recurrence formula based on the optimality conditions for the most probable failure point (MPP). It is shown that the approximate MPP, a key component of RBSO problems, is concurrently improved during each sub-programming solution step. Through analytical models and comparative studies over complex examples, it is illustrated that our approach is efficient and that a linearized reliability index is a good approximation of the accurate reliability index. These unique features and the concurrent convergence of design optimization and reliability calculation are demonstrated with several numerical examples.},

abstract = {The traffic state in an urban transportation network is determined via spatio-temporal traffic propagation. In early traffic forecasting studies, time-series models were adopted to accommodate autocorrelations between traffic states. The incorporation of spatial correlations into the forecasting of traffic states, however, involved a computational burden. Deep learning technologies were recently introduced to traffic forecasting in order to accommodate the spatio-temporal dependencies among traffic states. In the present study, we devised a novel graph-based neural network that expanded the existing graph convolutional neural network (GCN). The proposed model allowed us to differentiate the intensity of connecting to neighbor roads, unlike existing GCNs that give equal weight to each neighbor road. A plausible model architecture that mimicked real traffic propagation was established based on the graph convolution. The domain knowledge was efficiently incorporated into a neural network architecture. The present study also employed a generative adversarial framework to ensure that a forecasted traffic state could be as realistic as possible considering the joint probabilistic density of real traffic states. The forecasting performance of the proposed model surpassed that of the original GCN model, and the estimated adjacency matrices revealed the hidden nature of real traffic propagation.},

abstract = {Smart cities are nowadays equipped with pervasive networks of sensors that monitor traffic in real-time and record huge volumes of traffic data. These datasets constitute a rich source of information that can be used to extract knowledge useful for municipalities and citizens. In this paper we are interested in exploiting such data to estimate future speed in traffic sensor networks, as accurate predictions have the potential to enhance decision making capabilities of traffic management systems. Building effective speed prediction models in large cities poses important challenges that stem from the complexity of traffic patterns, the number of traffic sensors typically deployed, and the evolving nature of sensor networks. Indeed, sensors are frequently added to monitor new road segments or replaced/removed due to different reasons (e.g., maintenance). Exploiting a large number of sensors for effective speed prediction thus requires smart solutions to collect vast volumes of data and train effective prediction models. Furthermore, the dynamic nature of real-world sensor networks calls for solutions that are resilient not only to changes in traffic behavior, but also to changes in the network structure, where the cold start problem represents an important challenge. We study three different approaches in the context of large and dynamic sensor networks: local, global, and cluster-based. The local approach builds a specific prediction model for each sensor of the network. Conversely, the global approach builds a single prediction model for the whole sensor network. Finally, the cluster-based approach groups sensors into homogeneous clusters and generates a model for each cluster. We provide a large dataset, generated from ∼1.3 billion records collected by up to 272 sensors deployed in Fortaleza, Brazil, and use it to experimentally assess the effectiveness and resilience of prediction models built according to the three aforementioned approaches. The results show that the global and cluster-based approaches provide very accurate prediction models that prove to be robust to changes in traffic behavior and in the structure of sensor networks.},

abstract = {Region-level passenger demand prediction plays an important role in the coordination of travel demand and supply in the urban public transportation system. The complex urban road network structure leads to irregular shapes and arrangements of regions, which poses a challenge for capturing the spatio-temporal correlation of demand generated in different regions. In this study, we propose a multi-community spatio-temporal graph convolutional network (MC_STGCN) framework to predict passenger demand at a multi-region level by exploring spatio-temporal correlations among regions. Specifically, the gated recurrent unit (GRU) is applied to encode the temporal correlation in regions into a vector. On the other hand, the spatial correlations among regions are encoded into two graphs through the graph convolutional network (GCN): geographically adjacent graph and functional similarity graph. Then, a prediction module based on the Louvain algorithm is used to accomplish the passenger demand prediction of multi-regions. The two real-world taxi order data collected in Shenzhen City and New York City are used in model validation and comparison. The numerical results show that the MC_STGCN model outperforms both classical time-series prediction methods and deep learning approaches. Moreover, in order to better illustrate the superiority of the proposed model, we further discuss the improvement of prediction performance though spatio-temporal correlation modeling and analyzing, the effectiveness of community detection compared with random classification of regions, and the advantages of regional level prediction compared with grid-based prediction models.},

abstract = {This paper analyzes the problem of the design of envelopes for high-rise isolated residential buildings. The phenomenon of envelope creation appears in the early stages of the architectural design. Variables that influence the final shape and size of such envelopes are then identified. This paper presents the state-of-the-art tools for the current solutions at the commercial and academic/scientific level. The variables identified in this research are the client's needs, the urban code and architectural practice, and their specific components for the final creation of a new decision support system tool based on the building information modeling (BIM) software platform, to facilitate the work in the project development and drawing production stages. This tool generates several options for building envelopes according to the parameters required by the city Zoning Planning Commission. These options then lead to deliver reliable data and a geometry that can be analyzed in a timely fashion by the engineers, builders, architects, government, and clients in the early stages of the building's design. The results show that use of specific information and communication technologies (ICT) tools in the early stages of a building design helps reduce the working time, increases confidence in the generated solution, and contributes to the exploration of alternatives in a short period of time.},

In this sense we note that the students have difficulties in understanding and implementation of the problems proposed by the teacher. The main idea of this paper is to show that the logical reasoning of computer programming students can be efficiently developed by using at the same time Turing Machine, cellular automata (Wolfram rule) and fractals theory via Problem-Based Learning (PBL). The results indicate that this approach is useful, but the teacher needs introducing, in an interdisciplinary context, the simple theory of cellular automata and the fractals before the problem implementation. ?? 2010 Elsevier Ltd.

abstract = {While people's social backgrounds clearly shape their adoption of digital technology and the Internet, their urban lifestyles and place of residence better explain their digital activities when they are online, and how they use technology. Most studies investigating individuals' use of digitization have neglected the effects of the physical built environment and the daily life of the community. Addressing this gap, this paper places digital practices in the socio-spatial world, and conceptualizes the term “urban digital lifestyle,” which refers to the dynamic relationships among three dimensions: (1) the user's socioeconomic status, (2) the user's residency, with a focus on the locale's socio-spatial characteristics, and (3) the user's digital practices. Empirically, this paper uses a mixture of methods to analyze the digital usage of residents in four neighborhoods in Tel Aviv. The methods used are neighborhood prototype analysis, digital practices survey (n = 490), and spatial and GIS analyses. Although the results may at first glance support the argument that education and socioeconomic status have significant influence on digital practices, these practices also reflect many other factors associated with the urban lifestyle. Thus, locales, places and neighborhoods remain crucial socio-spatial categories that have a major influence on daily life in the digital age.},

Based on techniques from graphic statics, the force distribution in building structures is visualized using geometric diagrams. This diagrammatic representation allows a formal description that shows the relationship between the force flow and the structural form. The formal character of this description enables the direct implementation of a parametric truss geometry that maintains major structural behavioral characteristics under deformation. An interactive model of a structural freeform roof is developed through this link between a parametric truss definition and a design-driving NURBS surface. This allows for an intuitive exploration of the constrained design space in real time. Formal explorations and the comparison with built examples demonstrate the effectiveness of this approach.},

abstract = {Graphical statics is an almost forgotten, intuitive drawing method for solving plane mechanical problems. It was already in use in the 19th century for biomechanical problems. It was still a standard method employed by civil engineers in the 1940s. Superceded by modern analytical methods, graphical statics disappeared almost completely. The method is restricted to plane static problems, but still remains a useful tool for visualizing, understanding and checking the actions of force groups occurring in modern biomechanical problems. After defining the basic mechanical terminology (body, motion, forces), the paper is written mainly as a teaching tool for immediate application. Many illustrative examples (sporting activities, functional forces in joints) help to clarify the difficult biomechanical content. For application, it must be assumed that the bodies investigated behave as rigid bodies under the action of the forces, but this does not prevent application of the method to deformable living bodies if specific static configurations of the bodies are considered. The application of the method requires a good anatomical knowledge and experience with the function of the musculo-skeletal apparatus of living bodies. If reliable models are used, the method delivers quantitative results of sufficient accuracy. The paper may also help provide a better understanding of publications containing graphical solutions to bio-static problems. Die graphische Statik ist eine fast vergessene, intuitive zeichnerische Methode zur L{\"{o}}sung von mechanischen Problemen in einer Ebene. Sie wurde bereits im 19. Jahrhundert f{\"{u}}r biomechanische Probleme verwendet. Noch in den 40er Jahren des 20. Jahrhunderts war sie eine von Bauingenieuren angewendete Standardmethode. Abgel{\"{o}}st von modernen analytischen Methoden, verschwand die graphische Statik fast vollst{\"{a}}ndig. Die Methode ist auf ebene Statikprobleme beschr{\"{a}}nkt, aber sie ist immer noch ein n{\"{u}}tzliches Werkzeug zur Veranschaulichung, zum Verst{\"{a}}ndnis und zur Kontrolle der Wirkung von Kr{\"{a}}ftegruppen, die bei modernen biomechanischen Problemen auftreten. Im Anschluss an die Definition der grundlegenden mechanischen Terminologie (K{\"{o}}rper, Bewegung, Kr{\"{a}}fte) ist der Artikel haupts{\"{a}}chlich als Lehrmittel zur unmittelbaren Anwendung gedacht. Zahlreiche Anschauungsbeispiele (sportliche Aktivit{\"{a}}ten, funktionelle Kr{\"{a}}fte in Gelenken) helfen bei der Erkl{\"{a}}rung des schwierigen biomechanischen Inhalts. F{\"{u}}r die Anwendung muss davon ausgegangen werden, dass die zu erforschenden K{\"{o}}rper sich unter der Kr{\"{a}}fteeinwirkung wie starre K{\"{o}}rper verhalten, was jedoch die Anwendung der Methode auf verformbare lebendige K{\"{o}}rper nicht ausschliesst, wenn spezifische statische Konfigurationen der K{\"{o}}rper ber{\"{u}}cksichtigt werden. Die Anwendung der Methode erfordert gute anatomische Kenntnisse und Erfahrung mit der Funktionsweise der Skelettmuskulatur lebender K{\"{o}}rper. Wenn zuverl{\"{a}}ssige Modelle verwendet werden, liefert die Methode ausreichend exakte quantitative Resultate. Der Artikel kann ebenfalls zu einem besseren Verst{\"{a}}ndnis von Ver{\"{o}}ffentlichungen mit graphischen L{\"{o}}sungen von bio-statischen Problemen beitragen. La statique graphique, une m{\'{e}}thode intuitive largement oubli{\'{e}}e, permet la r{\'{e}}solution de probl{\`{e}}mes de m{\'{e}}canique bidimensionnelle. Utilis{\'{e}}e d{\`{e}}s le XIXe si{\`{e}}cle en biom{\'{e}}canique, elle est toujours employ{\'{e}}e en g{\'{e}}nie civil dans les ann{\'{e}}es 40 comme m{\'{e}}thode standard. Mais, avec le d{\'{e}}veloppement de m{\'{e}}thodes analytiques modernes, la statique graphique est tomb{\'{e}}e dans l'oubli. Bien qu'applicable qu'aux probl{\`{e}}mes statiques bidimensionnelles, elle reste un outil int{\'{e}}ressant pour mieux visualiser, comprendre et valider les actions de groupes de forces rencontr{\'{e}}s dans les probl{\`{e}}mes modernes de biom{\'{e}}canique. Apr{\`{e}}s avoir d{\'{e}}fini les termes m{\'{e}}caniques appropri{\'{e}}s (corps, mouvement, force), cet article se pr{\'{e}}sente principalement comme un outil de formation permettant une application imm{\'{e}}diate. Plusieurs exemples (activit{\'{e}}s sportives, forces fonctionnelles articulaires) illustrent sa capacit{\'{e}}{\`{a}}rendre plus lisible des probl{\`{e}}mes de biom{\'{e}}canique complexe. Lorsqu'on applique cette m{\'{e}}thode, on accepte l'hypoth{\`{e}}se que les corps{\'{e}}tudi{\'{e}}s et soumis{\`{a}}une force agissent en tant que corps rigides. Ceci n'est pas en contradiction avec son application aux corps vivants d{\'{e}}formables si l'on{\'{e}}tudie leurs configurations statiques sp{\'{e}}cifiques. La m{\'{e}}thode demande une bonne connaissance de l'anatomie fonctionnelle de l'appareil locomoteur des corps vivants. En se servant de mod{\`{e}}les fiables, elle permet l'acquisition de donn{\'{e}}es quantitatives d'une pr{\'{e}}cision satisfaisante. Le but de cet article est de favoriser une meilleure compr{\'{e}}hension des publications pr{\'{e}}sentant des solutions graphiques de probl{\`{e}}mes de biom{\'{e}}canique statique. La est{\'{a}}tica gr{\'{a}}fica es un m{\'{e}}todo de dibujo intuitivo, casi olvidado, para resolver problemas mec{\'{a}}nicos en el plano. Ya se utilizaba en el siglo XIX para los problemas biomec{\'{a}}nicos. En los an˜os cuarenta era todav{\'{i}}a el m{\'{e}}todo est{\'{a}}ndar utilizado por los ingenieros civiles. Sustituida por los m{\'{e}}todos anal{\'{i}}ticos modernos, la est{\'{a}}tica gr{\'{a}}fica desapareci{\'{o}}casi por completo. El m{\'{e}}todo ha quedado limitado a problemas est{\'{a}}ticos en el plano pero sigue siendo una herramienta{\'{u}}til a la hora de visualizar, entender y verificar las acciones de grupos de fuerzas que se dan en los problemas biomec{\'{a}}nicos modernos. Tras definir la terminolog{\'{i}}a mec{\'{a}}nica b{\'{a}}sica (cuerpo, movimiento, fuerzas), el trabajo se ha escrito principalmente a modo de herramienta de ensen˜anza para aplicaci{\'{o}}n inmediata. La inclusi{\'{o}}n de muchos ejemplos ilustrativos (actividades deportivas, fuerzas funcionales en las articulaciones) ayudan a aclarar el dif{\'{i}}cil contenido biomec{\'{a}}nico. Para su aplicaci{\'{o}}n, es necesario asumir que los cuerpos investigados se comportan como cuerpos r{\'{i}}gidos bajo la acci{\'{o}}n de las fuerzas, pero esto no implica que no pueda aplicarse el m{\'{e}}todo a cuerpos vivos deformables siempre que se consideren configuraciones est{\'{a}}ticas espec{\'{i}}ficas de estos cuerpos.

abstract = {Modelling with constraints is a modern approach to product modelling. Engineering knowledge is associated with geometry and topology in the product model. Together with the technique of feature based modelling, modelling with constraints has widely affected the development of new CAD-systems. The architecture of so called parametric CAD-systems reflects the impact of these new technologies. Besides the new hybrid modellers of geometry and topology, the sketcher and the constraint solver have become key components in a parametric CAD-system. The sketcher may be regarded as a designer interface for modelling with constraints. Moreover rule-based methods of automatic constraint detection are applied in sketchers. Constraint solvers evaluate the network of constraints formulated by the sketcher as a set of equations or predicates using numeric or symbolic algorithms or rule based approaches. The article closes with a summary of the advantages and risks of designing with constraints, showing typical application fields of this modelling technique and discussing some open issues.},

From an energy perspective during early architectural design, the refinement of design parameters by addition of information allows a more precise prediction of building performance. The need for energy-efficient buildings requires a designer to focus on the parameters in order of their ability to reduce uncertainty in energy performance to prioritise energy relevant decisions. However, there is no method for assigning and prioritising information for a particular level of multi-LOD. In this study, we performed a sensitivity analysis of energy models to estimate the uncertainty caused by the design parameters in energy prediction. This study allows to rank the design parameters in order of their influence on the energy prediction and determine the information required at each level of multi-LOD approach. We have studied the parametric energy model of different building shapes representing architectural design variation at the early design stage. A variance-based sensitivity analysis method is used to calculate the uncertainty contribution of each design parameter. The three levels in the uncertainty contribution by the group of parameters are identified which form the basis of information required at each level of multi-LOD BIM approach. The first level includes geometrical parameters, the second level includes technical specification and operational design parameters, and the third level includes window construction and system efficiency parameters. These findings will be specifically useful in the development of a multi-LOD approach to prioritise performance relevant decisions at early design phases.},

By identifying independent states of equilibrium of funicular networks with any topology and fixed plan geometry, a robust and efficient solving algorithm is presented that allows practical limit analysis of (historic) masonry vaults with complex geometry under parallel loading conditions by fitting a provided geometrical target, e.g. the vault's mid surface. The presented framework can be seen as a strong foundation for practical equilibrium analysis of vaulted masonry.},

Simulated annealing, a stochastic global optimization technique is implemented to find the optimal location of piezoelectric actuators in order to maximize its efficiency. The same technique is also used to solve optimization problems of piezolaminated plate structures where the discrete design variables are the ply orientation angles of orthotropic layers. The implemented scheme helps to recover from the premature convergence to a local optimum, without the need of reinitiating the optimal design process, as it is the case of the gradient-based methods with continuous design variables. To show the performance of the proposed optimization methods, two illustrative and simple examples are presented and discussed.},

It argues that optimization models are particularly well suited to the provision of design information because they produce results which are prescriptive, express design options and address the problems of the stability and sensitivity of solutions to changes over time. The difficulties posed by the multiple objectives which characterize architectural design problems are discussed and some solution approaches are described. The paper concludes that optimization concepts offer a powerful approach to design decision making and warrant much more research activity in the development of techniques and models for application in architecture.},

abstract = {Fires or electrical hazards and accidents can occur if vegetation is not controlled or cleared around overhead power lines, resulting in serious risks to people and property and significant costs to the community. There are numerous blackouts due to interfering the trees with the power transmission lines in hilly and urban areas. Power distribution companies are facing a challenge to monitor the vegetation to avoid blackouts and flash-over threats. Recently, several methods have been developed for vegetation monitoring; however, existing methods are either not accurate or could not provide better disparity map in the textureless region. Moreover, are not able to handle depth discontinuity in stereo thus are not able to find a feasible solution in the smooth areas to compute the disparity map. This study presents a cost-effective framework based on UAV and satellite Stereo images to monitor the trees and vegetation, which provide better disparity. We present a novel approach based on the fusion of the convolutional neural network (CNN) and sparse representation that handled textureless region, depth discontinuity and smooth region to produce better disparity map that further used for threat estimation using height and distance of vegetation/trees near power lines and poles. Extensive experimental evaluation on real time powerline monitoring showed considerable imporvemnt in vegetation threat estimation with accuracy of 90.3% in comparison to graph-cut, dynamic programming, belief propagation, and area-based methods.},

abstract = {Although IP multicast has been proposed and investigated for years, there are major problems inherent in the IP multicasting technique, e.g. difficulty to scale up the system, difficulty in allocating a globally unique multicast address, complexity in supporting higher level features such as reliable data transfer and congestion/flow control, more importantly, difficulty to deploy on the current Internet infrastructure due to necessity to change many core routers. Recently, end-system multicast (ESM) has been proposed as an alternative solution so that multicasting services can be quickly deployed. In this paper, we consider the 'architectural' and 'optimization' issues on designing an ESM-tree. Specifically, we present a distributed algorithm on how to create and maintain an ESM-tree. We propose a distributed algorithm to perform tree optimization (TO) so that an ESM-tree can dynamically adapt to the changing network condition (e.g. drop in transfer bandwidth) so that the nodes within an ESM-tree can receive data more efficiently. The distributed algorithm has the important theoretical properties that at all times, a tree topology can be maintained and any node joining, leaving, as well as any TO operation will not 'partition' the underlying ESM-tree. Therefore, our work can be used to provide an efficient architectural infrastructure for ESM services. We have implemented a prototype ESM system and carried out experiments to illustrate the effectiveness and the performance gains of our ESM optimization protocol. ?? 2004 Elsevier B.V.

abstract = {Spatial allocation is the process of assigning different attributes (e.g., land-use or land-cover) to spatial entities (e.g., map polygons or grid cells). It is an exercise that often requires the analysis of multiple, sometimes conflicting, objectives. Multi-objective spatial allocation problems often exhibit substantial computational complexity, especially when spatial pattern characteristics are specified as the allocation objectives. Optimization techniques that incorporate heuristics or knowledge-informed rules have been found to be more effective in solving spatial allocation problem. In this article, we (1) develop and demonstrate a knowledge-informed Pareto simulated annealing approach to tackle specifically multi-objective allocation problems that consider spatial patterns as objectives and (2) determine whether the knowledge-informed approach is more effective than standard Pareto simulation annealing in solving multi-objective spatial allocation problems. Four multi-objective spatial allocation problems were formulated in a gridded two-dimensional discrete space to benchmark the performance of our knowledge-informed algorithms and a standard Pareto simulated annealing algorithm. These four problems, each with two objectives, represent all combinations of cases in which there are (1) conflicting or concordant objectives and (2) two pattern objectives or one pattern objective and one non-pattern objective, representing objectives with similar or different degrees of difficulty. We generated 1200 sets of solutions, represented as allocation maps. Performance indices that measure the computational effectiveness and efficiency were developed for evaluation. The results suggest that the solutions generated by the knowledge-informed approach are more effective in approximating the set of Pareto optimal solutions than those generated by the standard Pareto simulated annealing.},

abstract = {Accurate cellular traffic prediction is challenging due to the complex spatial topology of cellular network and the dynamic temporal feature of mobile traffic. To overcome these problems, this paper proposes a spatial-temporal aggregation graph convolution network (STAGCN), in which the daily historical pattern and the hourly current-day pattern of mobile traffic are modeled. Moreover, the complex spatial-temporal correlation is captured by an aggregation graph convolution network for all nodes across different timestamps. The external factors&#x2019; impact on mobile traffic is fed into a regression module at the last step to obtain the predicted traffic. Experimental results show that the proposed model can achieve better prediction performance than conventional methods with superior training efficiency.},

Fast-changing social contexts are dominated by the blurring of boundaries between work and play, information retrieval and use. Pliable and responsive digital environments raise the haptic and intuitive threshold of public and private space by harnessing physical and mental responses.

As a result, coding, or computer programming, is becoming a core skill requirement for many well-paying jobs. Coding skills are in-demand across a broad range of careers, not just for programmers. The ability not only to use but also to program software is often required of business people who work with data, of designers and marketers who create websites, of engineers who build products and technologies, and of scientists who conduct research. This report analyzes the job market demand for coding skills in order to highlight the breadth and magnitude of employer demand for these skills and the range of opportunities that learning to code can open for students. The intent of this research is to showcase for school counselors and K-12 students alike the importance of learning to code and the value these skills will have in the job market. The data contained in this report are drawn from 26 million U.S. online job postings collected in 2015 and have been analyzed to determine the specific jobs and skills that employers are seeking.},

abstract = {Cloud computing technology is regarded as a major transformational force that is causing unprecedented change across the communication and business disciplines. In the architecture, engineering and construction sector, cloud-BIM integration is considered to be the second generation of building information management (BIM) development, and is expected to produce another wave of change across the construction industry. Despite this, few studies to date have attempted to summarise the research literature on cloud-BIM. This paper explores the literature to identify the substantive work on cloud-BIM, particularly regarding building life cycle management, to provide valuable insight for practitioners and to propose avenues for further research. Thirty academic sources, including refereed journal articles and conference papers, were retrieved and analysed in terms of their research focus and nature of application. The review revealed that most cloud-BIM research has focused on the building planning/design and construction stages. The findings suggest that more research should be directed towards operation, maintenance and facility management, energy efficiency and the demolition and deconstruction stages of building life cycle management. Further empirical research on organisational and legal issues, including security, responsibility, liability and model ownership, of the cloud-BIM model is also needed},

abstract = {This paper reviews the state-of-the-art smart building research by a bibliometric analysis, a content analysis, and a qualitative review. The bibliometric analysis of 364 academic papers shows that smart building is a burgeoning, interdisciplinary field with a relatively high international collaboration level. Keyword's clustering identified two major themes: (1) IoT, WSN, and cloud computing for automation control and (2) the balance between energy efficiency and human comfort based on continuous monitoring and machine learning. The content analysis statistically detected a transition from the cyber-physical system (CPS) to the human-cyber-physical system (HCPS) in smart building research. We therefore proposed an HCPS framework with three dimensions—cyber-physical scale, human needs, and human roles—to summarize current research and discover potential gaps. Under this framework, five HCPS future research directions for occupants-centered smart buildings were proposed: adaptive building envelope, integrated building management system, enhanced building energy management, adaptive thermal comfort, and microgrid adoption.},

abstract = {The structure–property relationships in newly developed polymer micro-truss structures were investigated, correlating compressive behavior with structural features, including density, cell size and truss angle. These open-cellular polymer micro-truss structures were formed from an interpenetrating array of self-propagating polymer waveguides. Compression experiments verified that the effective modulus scaled linearly with the measured relative density of the micro-trusses and was reliably predicted from a simple analytical model. However, the measured peak strength at initial truss member buckling was well below the values predicted from inelastic buckling theory, which was attributed to imperfections in the structure and the nonlinear compressive behavior of the solid polymer. In addition, a micro-truss structure was post cured at a higher temperature in an oxidizing environment which suppressed the tendency for truss members to prematurely buckle. The polymer modulus increased by approximately 40% and the peak strength of the micro-truss structure nearly doubled to 5.9MPa.},

abstract = {Spatial–temporal event prediction is a particular task for multivariate time series forecasting. Therefore, the complex entangled dynamics of space and time need to be considered. This task is an essential but crucial loop in future smart cities construction, which can be widely applied in urban traffic management, disaster monitoring and mobility analysis. In recent years, video-like spatial–temporal modelling has been the most common approach in many deep learning models. However, the video-like modelling approach cannot consider some latent region-wise correlations other than geographic spatial distance information. To overcome the limitation, we propose a novel neural network framework, Adaptive Dual-View WaveNet (ADVW-Net), for the urban spatial–temporal event prediction. By integrating the spatial representations from Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) and that from adaptive Graph convolutional neural network (GCN), our proposed model can capture not only the geographic correlations but also some latent region-wise dependencies from the input data. In addition, the effective architecture, WaveNet, can be transferred to region-wise spatial–temporal prediction scenarios for long-range temporal dependencies learning. Experimental results on three urban datasets demonstrate the superior performance of our proposed model.},

A number of decisions are to be taken, such as optimizing the displacement of UI items on the available screen space or selecting an adequate palette of colors. Therefore, the UI design process is iterative in nature, time consuming, and costly. Generative design, while keeping the centrality of human creativity, introduces a novel approach to assist humans in finding effective and esthetically convincing solutions. Meta-heuristics are a means to apply generative design in practice. We advocate the use of meta-heuristics to supporting different aspects of the UI design process. In this paper we discuss the application of genetic algorithms to solve two different problems: building hierarchical menu layouts and selecting color palettes based on a set of constraints.

Experimental analyses are presented to investigate the performance of the proposed PSO-based methodology, including comparison of the two representations and comparison with other approaches for the RCPSP.

Big data has advantages of revealing individual characteristics rather than a general feature by traditional statistics, and it is consistent with the idea of people-oriented urbanization and urban–rural planning. The research progress of big data since 2000 in China is reviewed in this paper. Focusing on behavior big data mining and big data application in urban studies and planning practices, the review is proposed from four parts, involving behavior data acquisition & analysis, spatial analysis, plan making & management application and new methodologies with big data. Lastly, some open research issues such as potential challenges and possible directions of development are discussed.},

abstract = {Generative systems have been widely used to produce two- and three-dimensional constructs, in an attempt to escape from our preconceptions and pre-existing spatial language. The challenge is to use this mechanism in real-world architectural contexts in which complexity and constraints imposed by the design problem make it difficult to negotiate between the emergent output, the context, and the controllability desired by the human designer. This thesis investigates how generative systems address contextual parameters, including the designer, client, user, meaning, aesthetics, environment, and function. This is demonstrated through my case studies, in which my aim was to avoid computerized unprocessed formalism that does not implicitly allow for any contextual and cultural content. I sought to extend simple algorithmic form-generation processes to allow for the subtleties of a given context to be effectively addressed. Some challenges and questions arose from these case studies. By interrogating different generative machines, common threads and challenges, similar to mine encountered in the case studies, were found. All of the processes that strove towards the creation of a generative system struggled with similar issues: How can we use rule-based systems without sacrificing meaning or function or the humanistic touch? How can we address contextual parameters without a loss?; by Saeed Arida.; Thesis (S.M.)--Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Dept. of Architecture, 2004.; Includes bibliographical references (p. 107-[110]).},

abstract = {The progress in the field of Machine Learning (ML) has enabled the automation of tasks that were considered impossible to program until recently. These advancements today have incited firms to seek intelligent solutions as part of their enterprise software stack. Even governments across the globe are motivating firms through policies to tape into ML arena as it promises opportunities for growth, productivity and efficiency. In reflex, many firms embark on ML without knowing what it entails. The outcomes so far are not as expected because the ML, as hyped by tech firms, is not the silver bullet. However, whatever ML offers, firms urge to capitalise it for their competitive advantage. Applying ML to real-life construction industry problems goes beyond just prototyping predictive models. It entails intensive activities which, in addition to training robust ML models, provides a comprehensive framework for answering questions asked by construction folks when intelligent solutions are getting deployed at their premises to substitute or facilitate their decision-making tasks. Existing ML guidelines used in the IT industry are vastly restricted to training ML models. This paper presents guidelines for Applied Machine Learning (AML) in the construction industry from training to operationalising models, which are drawn from our experience of working with construction folks to deliver Construction Simulation Tool (CST). The unique aspect of these guidelines lies not only in providing a novel framework for training models but also answering critical questions related to model confidence, trust, interpretability, bias, feature importance and model extrapolation capabilities. Generally, ML models are presumed black boxes; hence argued that nobody knows what a model learns and how it generates predictions. Even very few ML folks barely know approaches to answer questions asked by the end users. Without explaining the competence of ML, the broader adoption of intelligent solutions in the construction industry cannot be attained. This paper proposed a detailed process for AML to develop intelligent solutions in the construction industry. Most discussions in the study are elaborated in the context of profit margin estimation for new projects.},

This paradigm shift has also set up new expectations on college students for their competencies in sustainability and BIM. While most higher education institutions have already incorporated such topics in their curricula, green building and BIM are typically taught separately. In this study, instructors from two classes adopted an integrated approach and designed a joint course project focusing on both sustainable design and BIM implementation. With BIM facilitation, students collaborated in teams working on artefacts and other tasks to accomplish predefined sustainable goals for a real building project. The project based learning provides an ideal framework to evaluate critical factors that influence the execution of BIM in green building project delivery. Formative and summative assessments of student learning outcomes in model communication, teamwork, critical thinking, problem-solving, and sustainability were conducted. The results of this study provide insight into innovative pedagogic design for sustainability and BIM education in the AEC curricula. The study also confirmed the effectiveness of project based learning in cultivating student competencies in critical thinking and problem-solving within a multidisciplinary project environment.},

abstract = {The need to design and construct structural systems with adequate levels of reliability and redundancy is widely acknowledged. It is as crucial that these desired levels are maintained above target levels throughout the life of the structure. Optimization has served well in providing safer and more economical maintenance strategies. Lifetime maintenance optimization based on system reliability has already been proposed. It is still needed, however, to incorporate redundancy in the lifetime maintenance optimization process. Treating both system reliability and redundancy as criteria in the lifetime optimization process can be highly rewarding. The complexity of the process, however, requires the automation of solving the optimization problem. Genetic algorithms (GAs) are used in this study to obtain solutions to the multi-objective optimization problems considering system reliability, redundancy and life-cycle cost (LCC). An approach to provide the optimization program the ability to optimally select what maintenance actions are applied, when they are applied, and to which structural components they are applied is presented. Two different strategies are proposed. The first strategy has the ability to optimally select mixed maintenance types to apply to different parts of the structure at the same time. This strategy can be used in cases where any combination of different maintenance options can be practically applied to any part of the structure. The application of this strategy on truss structures is shown in a numerical example. The second strategy can be used when a limited number of possibilities of practical maintenance options are available. The application of this strategy to bridge structures is shown in a numerical example. The greatest advantage of the proposed approach (both strategies) is its ability to avoid the application of maintenance interventions to structural components that are not critical. ?? 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

However, the diversity of terminology used means that the full potential of these review types may be lost amongst a confusion of indistinct and misapplied terms. The objective of this study is to provide descriptive insight into the most common types of reviews, with illustrative examples from health and health information domains. Methods: Following scoping searches, an examination was made of the vocabulary associated with the literature of review and synthesis (literary warrant). A simple analytical framework - Search, AppraisaL, Synthesis and Analysis (SALSA) - was used to examine the main review types. Results: Fourteen review types and associated methodologies were analysed against the SALSA framework, illustrating the inputs and processes of each review type. A description of the key characteristics is given, together with perceived strengths and weaknesses. A limited number of review types are currently utilized within the health information domain. Conclusions: Few review types possess prescribed and explicit methodologies and many fall short of being mutually exclusive. Notwithstanding such limitations, this typology provides a valuable reference point for those commissioning, conducting, supporting or interpreting reviews, both within health information and the wider health care domain. {\textcopyright} 2009 Health Libraries Group.},

abstract = {We present a novel method for real-time rendering of subdivision surfaces whose goal is to make subdivision faces as easy to ren- der as triangles, points, or lines. Our approach uses standard GPU tessellation hardware and processes each face of a base mesh inde- pendently, thus allowing an entire model to be rendered in a single pass. The key idea of our method is to subdivide the u, v domain of each face ahead of time, generating a quadtree structure, and then submit one tessellated primitive per input face. By traversing the quadtree for each post-tessellation vertex, we are able to accurately and efficiently evaluate the limit surface. Our method yields a more uniform tessellation of the surface, and faster rendering, as fewer primitives are submitted. We evaluate our method on a variety of assets, and realize performance that can be three times faster than state-of-the-art approaches. In addition, our streaming formulation makes it easier to integrate subdivision surfaces into applications and shader code written for polygonal models. We illustrate inte- gration of our technique into a full-featured video game engine.},

The final prediction is given by the combination of base classifiers, and we define a pseudo-validation set to regulate their weight.

abstract = {In Shape, George Stiny argues that seeing shapes -- with all their changeability and ambiguity -- is an inexhaustible source of creative ideas. Understanding shapes, he says, is a useful way to understand what is possible in design.Shapes are devices for visual expression just as symbols are devices for verbal expression. Stiny develops a unified scheme that includes both visual expression with shapes and verbal expression with signs. The relationships -- and equivalencies -- between the two kinds of expressive devices make design comparable to other professional practices that rely more on verbal than visual expression. Design uses shapes while business, engineering, law, mathematics, and philosophy turn mainly to symbols, but the difference, says Stiny, isn't categorical. Designing is a way of thinking. Designing, Stiny argues, is calculating with shapes, calculating without equations and numbers but still according to rules. Stiny shows that the mechanical process of calculation is actually a creative process when you calculate with shapes -- when you can reason with your eyes, when you learn to see instead of count.The book takes the idea of design as calculation from mere heuristic or metaphor to a rigorous relationship in which design and calculation each inform and enhance the other. Stiny first demonstrates how seeing and counting differ when you use rules -- that is, what it means to calculate with your eyes -- then shows how to calculate with shapes, providing formal details. He gives practical applications in design with specific visual examples. The book is extraordinarily visual, with many drawings throughout -- drawings punctuated with words.

abstract = {The recent development in the technology brings the concept of Smart City that is achieved through real-time city related intelligent decisions by analyzing the data harvested from various smart systems in the city using millions of sensors and devices connected over the Internet, termed as Internet of Things (IoT). These devices generate the overwhelming volume of high-speed streaming data, termed as Big Data. However, the generation of city data at a remote location and then transmitting it to central city servers for analysis purpose raises the concerns of security and privacy. On the other hand, providing security to such Big Data streaming requires a high-speed security system that can work in a real-time environment without providing any delay that may slow down the overall performance of the Smart City System. To overthrown these challenges, in this paper, we proposed an efficient and real-time Smart City security system by providing strong intrusion detection at intelligent city building (ICB) and also a security protocol to protect the communication between the remote smart system(RSS)/User and the city analysis building, i.e., ICB. The proposed communication security protocol consists of various phases, i.e., registration phase, session key exchange phase, session key revocation phase, and data transmission phases from RSS to ICB as well as from User to ICB. Vast security analyses are performed to evaluate the credibility of the system. The proposed system is also evaluated on efficiency in terms of computation cost and throughput of overall functions used in the system. The system's evaluation and the comparative study with existing system show that the prosed system is secure, more efficient, and able to work in a real-time, high-speed Smart City environment.},

abstract = {The ability to process large amounts of data and to extract useful insights from data has revolutionised society. This phenomenon—dubbed as Big Data—has applications for a wide assortment of industries, including the construction industry. The construction industry already deals with large volumes of heterogeneous data; which is expected to increase exponentially as technologies such as sensor networks and the Internet of Things are commoditised. In this paper, we present a detailed survey of the literature, investigating the application of Big Data techniques in the construction industry. We reviewed related works published in the databases of American Association of Civil Engineers (ASCE), Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers (IEEE), Association of Computing Machinery (ACM), and Elsevier Science Direct Digital Library. While the application of data analytics in the construction industry is not new, the adoption of Big Data technologies in this industry remains at a nascent stage and lags the broad uptake of these technologies in other fields. To the best of our knowledge, there is currently no comprehensive survey of Big Data techniques in the context of the construction industry. This paper fills the void and presents a wide-ranging interdisciplinary review of literature of fields such as statistics, data mining and warehousing, machine learning, and Big Data Analytics in the context of the construction industry. We discuss the current state of adoption of Big Data in the construction industry and discuss the future potential of such technologies across the multiple domain-specific sub-areas of the construction industry. We also propose open issues and directions for future work along with potential pitfalls associated with Big Data adoption in the industry.},

abstract = {Building information modeling (BIM) is the digital representation of physical and functional characteristics (such as geometry, spatial relationship, and geographic information) of a facility to support decisions during its life cycle. BIM has been extended beyond 3D geometrical representations in recent years, and now includes time as a fourth dimension and cost as a fifth dimension, as well as such other applications as virtual reality and augmented reality. The Internet of Things (IoT) has been increasingly applied in various products (smart homes, wearables) to enhance work productivity, living comfort, and entertainment. However, research addressing the integration of these two technologies (BIM and IoT) is still very limited, and has focused exclusively on the automatic transmission of sensor information to BIM models. This paper describes an attempt to represent and visualize sensor data in BIM with multiple perspectives in order to support complex decisions requiring interdisciplinary information. The study uses a university campus as an example and includes several scenarios, such as an auditorium with a dispersed audience and energy-saving options for rooms with different functions (mechanical/electrical equipment, classrooms, and laboratory). This paper also discusses the design of a common platform allowing communication among sensors with different protocols (Arduino, Raspberry Pi), the use of Dynamo to accept sensor data as input and automatically redraw visualized information in BIM, and how visualization may help in making energy-saving management decisions. {\textcopyright} 2018 by the authors.},

abstract = {Generative design systems coupled with objective functions can be efficiently explored through the use of stochastic optimization algorithms, such as genetic algorithms. The first step in implementing genetic algorithms is to define a representation, that is, the data structure representative of the genotype space and its mathematical relation to the data of the phenotype space - the variables of the real problem. This can be a hard task, particularly if the design system contains dependency between variables. This paper presents a general representation, which enables the use of standard variation operators, allows defining both continuous and discrete variables from a single type of gene and is easily adaptable to different problems, with a larger or smaller number of variables. This representation was created to solve the representation problem in the design system for Frank Lloyd Wright's prairie houses, a shape grammar that was converted into a parametric design system. {\textcopyright} 2013 Elsevier B.V.},

The paper focuses on a specific type of topological parameter, called non-manifold topology as a novel approach to thinking about designing cellular spaces and voids. The approach is illustrated within the context of additive manufacturing of non-conformal cellular structures. The paper concludes that parametric design thinking that omits a definition of topological relationships risks brittleness and failure in later design stages while a consideration of topology can create enhanced and smarter solutions as it can modify parameters based on an accommodation of the design context.},

@article{Quattrini2017,
abstract = {In the last decade, the paradigm Historical Building Information Modeling (HBIM) was investigated to exploit the possibilities offered by the application of BIM to historical buildings. In the Cultural Heritage domain, the BIM-oriented approach can produce 3D models that are data collector populated by both geometrical and non-geometrical information related to various themes: historical documents, monitoring data, structural information, conservation or restoration state and so on. The realization of a 3D model fully interoperable and rich in its informative content could represent a very important change towards a more efficient management of the historical real estate. The work presented in these pages outlines a novel approach to solve this interoperability issue, by developing and testing a workflow that exploits the advantages of BIM platforms and Semantic-Web technologies, enabling the user to query a repository composed of semantically structured and rich HBIM data. The presented pipeline follows four main steps: (i) the first step consists on modeling an ontology with the main information needs for the domain of interest, providing a data structure that can be leveraged to inform the data-enrichment phase and, later, to meaningfully query the data. (ii) Afterwards, the data enrichment was performed, by creating a set of shared parameters reflecting the properties in our domain ontology. (iii) To structure data in a machine-readable format, a data conversion was needed to represent the domain (ontology) and analyze data of specific buildings respectively; this step is mandatory to reuse the analysis data together with the 3D model, providing the end-user with a querying tool. (iv) As a final step in our workflow, we developed a demonstrative data exploration web application based on the faceted browsing paradigm and allowing to exploit both structured metadata and 3D visualization. This research demonstrates how is possible to represent a huge amount of specialized information models with appropriate LOD and Grade in BIM environment and then guarantee a complete interoperability with IFC/RDF format. Relying on semantically structured data (ontologies) and on the Linked Data stack appears a valid approach for addressing existing information system issues in the CH domain and constitutes a step forward in the management of repositories and web libraries devoted to historical buildings.},

The similarities of the video stream and citywide traffic data structures are discovered and analogues between historical development and modern states of the methodologies are presented and discussed. The idea of transferring video prediction models to the urban traffic forecasting domain is validated using a large real-world traffic data set. The list of transferred techniques includes spatial filtering by predefined kernels in combination with time series models and spectral graph convolutional artificial neural networks. The obtained models' forecasting performance is compared to the baseline traffic forecasting models: non-spatial time series models and spatially regularized vector autoregression models. We conclude that the application of video prediction models and algorithms for urban traffic forecasting is effective both in terms of observed forecasting accuracy and development, and training efforts. Finally, we discuss problems and obstacles of transferring methodologies and present potential directions for further research.},

abstract = {Real-world multi-objective engineering design optimization problems often have parameters with uncontrollable variations. The aim of solving such problems is to obtain solutions that in terms of objectives and feasibility are as good as possible and at the same time are least sensitive to the parameter variations. Such solutions are said to be robust optimum solutions. In order to investigate the trade-off between the performance and robustness of optimum solutions, we present a new Robust Multi-Objective Genetic Algorithm (RMOGA) that optimizes two objectives: a fitness value and a robustness index. The fitness value serves as a measure of performance of design solutions with respect to multiple objectives and feasibility of the original optimization problem. The robustness index, which is based on a non-gradient based parameter sensitivity estimation approach, is a measure that quantitatively evaluates the robustness of design solutions. RMOGA does not require a presumed probability distribution of uncontrollable parameters and also does not utilize the gradient information of these parameters. Three distance metrics are used to obtain the robustness index and robust solutions. To illustrate its application, RMOGA is applied to two well-studied engineering design problems from the literature.},

abstract = {In the Korean housing market, mass customization (MC) is an inevitable strategy for ensuring competitiveness. However, though customer needs have varied rapidly under the customer-oriented market conditions, the level of customization for houses has been restricted by economics of scale in the construction processes. With the rise of the level of customization, the cost of site management has increased because of additional labour. Therefore, this paper introduces the finishing information system (FIS), which can be used to minimize the additional commitment of manpower due to higher levels of MC. To illustrate and validate this system, a case study was performed in a real apartment complex project. The results showed that additional manpower for site management was decreased by quicker completion of the job, simplification of the management process, and efficiency of communication.},

abstract = {During the coronavirus disease 2019 pandemic, the activity engagement and travel behavior of city residents have been impacted by government restrictions, such as temporary city-wide lockdowns, the closure of public areas and public transport suspension. Based on multiple heterogeneous data sources, which include aggregated mobility change reports and household survey data, this paper proposes a machine learning approach for dynamic activity chain pattern estimation with improved interpretability for examining behavioral pattern adjustments. Based on historical household survey samples, we first establish a computational graph-based discrete choice model to estimate the baseline travel tour parameters before the pandemic. To further capture structural deviations of activity chain patterns from day-by-day time series, we define the activity-oriented deviation parameters within an interpretable utility-based nested logit model framework, which are further estimated through a constrained optimization problem. By incorporating the long short-term memory method as the explainable module to capture the complex periodic and trend information before and after interventions, we predict day-to-day activity chain patterns with more accuracy. The performance of our model is examined based on publicly available datasets such as the 2017 National Household Travel Survey in the United States and the Google Global Mobility Dataset throughout the epidemic period. Our model could shed more light on transportation planning, policy adaptation and management decisions during the pandemic and post-pandemic phases.},

Recent cases and studies show that a key factor in this transformation is the use of urban big data from stakeholders and physical objects in cities. However, the knowledge and framework for data use for smart cities remain relatively unknown. This paper reports findings from an analysis of various use cases of big data in cities worldwide and the authors' four projects with government organizations toward developing smart cities. Specifically, this paper classifies the urban data use cases into four reference models and identifies six challenges in transforming data into information for smart cities. Furthermore, building upon the relevant literature, this paper proposes five considerations for addressing the challenges in implementing the reference models in real-world applications. The reference models, challenges, and considerations collectively form a framework for data use for smart cities. This paper will contribute to urban planning and policy development in the modern data-rich economy.},

abstract = {Urban energy modelling requires a large amount of detailed data to perform systematic dynamic simulations of a large number of buildings, where the adoption of energy efficiency strategies is an important concern for sustainable urban planning. National statistical datasets collect important aggregated data regarding building construction, energy consumption and occupants, and cities are making a significant effort to update spatial referenced data of their territory. However, these data is generally not detailed enough, being available at different scales and in different formats. The integrated use of these data is critical to validate different methods to predict and model energy consumption in cities, as well in addressing its energy saving potential. Furthermore, scenario analysis for retrofit or new design is only possible at building scale, highlighting the potential of a bottom-up database. This paper presents the process of collecting, mapping, cleansing and integrating urban data resulting in an UBD to support an information system for Smart Cities. The goal is to reduce the gap between the available urban data and the specific data required to run a complete urban building energy simulation. Key characteristics of an UBD are explored and applied to a case study in Lisbon, Portugal. As a result, a Buildings Dashboard is developed, materializing the UBD user interface. This dashboard allows the interactive visualization and data exploration of the building stock at multiple scales. Future work includes the development of an Urban Scenario category, bringing new insights on urban energy simulation and scenario evaluation to this platform.},

abstract = {Traffic forecasting has attracted considerable attention due to its importance in proactive urban traffic control and management. Scholars and engineers have exerted considerable efforts in improving the performance of traffic forecasting algorithms in terms of accuracy, reliability, and efficiency. Spatial feature representation of traffic flow is a core component that greatly influences traffic forecasting performance. In previous studies, several spatial attributes of traffic flow are ignored due to the following issues: a) traffic flow propagation does not comply with the road network, b) the spatial pattern of traffic flow varies over time, and c) single adjacent matrix cannot handle the complex and hierarchical urban traffic flow. To address the abovementioned issues, this study proposes a novel traffic forecasting algorithm called traffic transformer, which achieves great success in natural language processing. The multihead attention mechanism and stacking layers enable the transformer to learn dynamic and hierarchical features in sequential data. Two components, namely, global encoder and global-local decoder, are proposed to extract and fuse the spatial patterns globally and locally. Experimental results indicate that the proposed traffic transformer outperforms state-of-the-art methods. The learned dynamic and hierarchical features of traffic flow can help achieve a better understanding of spatial dependency of traffic flow for effective and efficient traffic control and management strategies.},

abstract = {Accurate long-term origin-destination demand (OD) prediction can help understand traffic flow dynamics, which plays an essential role in urban transportation planning. However, the main challenge originates from the complex and dynamic spatial-temporal correlation of the time-varying traffic information. In response, a graph deep learning model for long-term OD prediction (ST-GDL) is proposed in this paper, which is among the pioneering work that obtains both short-term and long-term OD predictions simultaneously. ST-GDL avoids the conventional multi-step forecasting and thus prevents learning from prediction errors, rendering better long-term forecasts. The proposed method captures time attributes from multiple time scales, namely closeness, periodicity, and trend, to study the features with temporal dynamics. Besides, two gate mechanisms are introduced over the vanilla convolution operation to alleviates the error accumulation issue of typical recurrent forecast in long-term OD prediction. A method based on graph convolution is proposed to capture the dynamic spatial relationship, which projects the transportation network into a graphical time-series. Finally, the long-term OD prediction results are obtained by combining the extracted spatio-temporal features with external features from the meteorological information. Case studies on a practical dataset show that the proposed model is superior to existing methods in long-term OD prediction problems.},

@article{Beck2012,
abstract = {In this paper, the effects of uncertainty and expected costs of failure on optimum structural design are investigated, by comparing three distinct formulations of structural optimization problems. Deterministic Design Optimization (DDO) allows one the find the shape or configuration of a structure that is optimum in terms of mechanics, but the formulation grossly neglects parameter uncertainty and its effects on structural safety. Reliability-based Design Optimization (RBDO) has emerged as an alternative to properly model the safety-under-uncertainty part of the problem. With RBDO, one can ensure that a minimum (and measurable) level of safety is achieved by the optimum structure. However, results are dependent on the failure probabilities used as constraints in the analysis. Risk optimization (RO) increases the scope of the problem by addressing the compromising goals of economy and safety. This is accomplished by quantifying the monetary consequences of failure, as well as the costs associated with construction, operation and maintenance. RO yields the optimum topology and the optimum point of balance between economy and safety. Results are compared for some example problems. The broader RO solution is found first, and optimum results are used as constraints in DDO and RBDO. Results show that even when optimum safety coefficients are used as constraints in DDO, the formulation leads to configurations which respect these design constraints, reduce manufacturing costs but increase total expected costs (including expected costs of failure). When (optimum) system failure probability is used as a constraint in RBDO, this solution also reduces manufacturing costs but by increasing total expected costs. This happens when the costs associated with different failure modes are distinct. Hence, a general equivalence between the formulations cannot be established. Optimum structural design considering expected costs of failure cannot be controlled solely by safety factors nor by failure probability constraints, but will depend on actual structural configuration. {\textcopyright} 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

abstract = {With all the recent attention focused on big data, it is easy to overlook that basic vital statistics remain difficult to obtain in most of the world. What makes this frustrating is that private companies hold potentially useful data, but it is not accessible by the people who can use it to track poverty, reduce disease, or build urban infrastructure. This project set out to test whether we can transform an openly available dataset (Twitter) into a resource for urban planning and development. We test our hypothesis by creating road traffic crash location data, which is scarce in most resource-poor environments but essential for addressing the number one cause of mortality for children over five and young adults. The research project scraped 874,588 traffic related tweets in Nairobi, Kenya, applied a machine learning model to capture the occurrence of a crash, and developed an improved geoparsing algorithm to identify its location. We geolocate 32,991 crash reports in Twitter for 2012-2020 and cluster them into 22,872 unique crashes during this period. For a subset of crashes reported on Twitter, a motorcycle delivery service was dispatched in real-time to verify the crash and its location; the results show 92% accuracy. To our knowledge this is the first geolocated dataset of crashes for the city and allowed us to produce the first crash map for Nairobi. Using a spatial clustering algorithm, we are able to locate portions of the road network (<1%) where 50% of the crashes identified occurred. Even with limitations in the representativeness of the data, the results can provide urban planners with useful information that can be used to target road safety improvements where resources are limited. The work shows how twitter data might be used to create other types of essential data for urban planning in resource poor environments.},

One heuristic that has been successfully applied to a variety of problems is Simulated Annealing. The performance of Simulated Annealing depends on the appropriate choice of a key parameter, the annealing schedule. Researchers usually experiment with some manually created annealing schedules and then use the one that performs best in their algorithms. This work replaces this manual search by Genetic Programming, a method based on natural evolution. We demonstrate the potential of this new approach by optimizing the annealing schedule for a well-known combinatorial optimization problem, the Quadratic Assignment Problem. We introduce two new algorithms for solving the Quadratic Assignment Problem that perform extremely well and outperform existing Simulated Annealing algorithms.},

abstract = {Mobile robots require object detection and classification for safe and smooth navigation. Stereo vision improves such detection by doubling the views of the scene and by giving indirect access to depth information. This depth information can also be used to reduce the set of candidate detection windows. Up to now, most algorithms compute a depth map to discard unpromising detection windows. We propose a novel approach where a stixel world model is computed directly from the stereo images, without computing an intermediate depth map. We experimentally demonstrate that such approach can considerably reduce the set of candidate detection windows at a fraction of the computation cost of previous approaches.},

The accurate estimation of rental and return demand of carsharing stations to support vehicle relocation is essential, hence a station-level short-term demand forecasting method named as station-embedding-based hybrid neural network (SEHNN) integrated by variational graph auto-encoder (VGAE) and long short-term memory network (LSTM) is proposed. The VGAE module undertakes the functions of station feature extraction and embedding, while the LSTM module captures the time series regularity and forecast the station-level demand. The results from the real data of Lanzhou, China demonstrate that, compared with ElasticNet, ARIMA, LSTM, and ConvLSTM, the mean absolute error of the proposed model targeted at hourly demand forecasting is reduced by 56.5%, 47.2%, 38.7%, and 38.5%, respectively, and it also outperforms some widely used models among different intervals and scales including main stations and subset carsharing system.},

abstract = {Systematic mapping was developed in social sciences in response to a lack of empirical data when answering questions using systematic review methods, and a need for a method to describe the literature across a broad subject of interest. Systematic mapping does not attempt to answer a specific question as do systematic reviews, but instead collates, describes and catalogues available evidence (e.g. primary, secondary, theoretical, economic) relating to a topic or question of interest. The included studies can be used to identify evidence for policy-relevant questions, knowledge gaps (to help direct future primary research) and knowledge clusters (sub-sets of evidence that may be suitable for secondary research, for example systematic review). Evidence synthesis in environmental sciences faces similar challenges to those found in social sciences. Here we describe the translation of systematic mapping methodology from social sciences for use in environmental sciences. We provide the first process-based methodology for systematic maps, describing the stages involved: establishing the review team and engaging stakeholders; setting the scope and question; setting inclusion criteria for studies; scoping stage; protocol development and publication; searching for evidence; screening evidence; coding; production of a systematic map database; critical appraisal (optional); describing and visualising the findings; report production and supporting information. We discuss the similarities and differences in methodology between systematic review and systematic mapping and provide guidance for those choosing which type of synthesis is most suitable for their requirements. Furthermore, we discuss the merits and uses of systematic mapping and make recommendations for improving this evolving methodology in environmental sciences.},

This unified representation is applied to a simple Maxwell frame and the authors include a rigorous investigation of the equivalence between the unified diagram and traditional diagrams. The paper shows that traditional diagrams can, in fact, be regarded as particular cases of the unified diagram. The concept of self-reciprocity is introduced and a dual kinematic interpretation of the unified diagram is obtained from a sequence of equivalent diagrams. These diagrams can be obtained in a straightforward manner by changing the force scale factor. {\textcopyright} 2009 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

The continuous devaluation of bank shares in the financial sector caused a great decrease in market capitalization, and in citizen and investor confidence. Panic among investors led them to sell shares, while other agents took the opportunity to buy them. Therefore, the study of bank shares is important, particularly of their efficiency. In this paper, adopting a sliding windows detrended fluctuation approach, we analyse the efficiency concept dynamically with 63 European banks (both in and outside the Eurozone). The main results show that the crisis had an effect on changing the efficiency pattern.},

abstract = {Elements that constitute the built environment are vast and so are the independent systems developed to model its various aspects. Many of these systems have been developed under various assumptions and approaches to execute functions that are distinct, complementary or sometimes similar. Furthermore, these systems are ever increasing in number and often assume similar nomenclatures and acronyms, thereby exacerbating the challenges of understanding their peculiar functions, definitions and differences. The current societal demand to improve sustainability per­formance through collaboration as well as whole-system and through-life thinking is driving the need to integrate independent systems associated with different aspects and scales of the built environment to deliver smart solutions and services that improve the well-being of citizens. The contemporary object-oriented digitization of real-world elements appears to provide a leeway for amalgamating the modelling systems of various domains in the built environment which we termed as built environment information modelling (BeIM). These domains include architecture, engineering, construction as well as urban planning and design. Applications such as building information modelling, geographic information systems and 3D city modelling systems are now being integrated for city modelling purposes. The various works directed at integrating these systems are examined, revealing that current research efforts on integration fall into three categories: (1) data/file conversion systems, (2) semantic mapping systems and (3) the hybrid of both.

abstract = {Architectural prototyping is the process of using executable code to investigate stakeholders' software architecture concerns with respect to a system under development. Previous work has established this as a useful and cost-effective way of exploration and learning of the design space of a system and in addressing issues regarding quality attributes, architectural risks, and the problem of knowledge transfer and conformance. However, the actual industrial use of architectural prototyping has not been thoroughly researched so far. In this article, we report from three studies of architectural prototyping in practice. First, we report findings from an ethnographic study of practicing software architects. Secondly, we report from a focus group on architectural prototyping involving architects from four companies. And, thirdly, we report from a survey study of 20 practicing software architects and software developers. Our findings indicate that architectural prototyping plays an important and frequent role in resolving problems experimentally, but less so in exploring alternative solutions. Furthermore, architectural prototypes include end-user or business related functionality rather than purely architectural functionality. Based on these observations we provide recommendations for effective industrial architectural prototyping.},

abstract = {Abstract: Despite successful application of constraint programming (CP) to solving many real-life problems there is still an indispensable group or researchers considering (wrongly) CP as a simple evaluation technique only. Even if sophisticated search algorithms play an important role in solving constraint-based models, the real power engine behind CP is called constraint propagation (domain filtering, pruning or consistency techniques). In the paper we give a survey of common consistency techniques for binary constraints. We describe the main ideas behind them, list their advantages and limitations, and compare their pruning power. Then we briefly explain how these techniques can be extended to non-binary constraints. Last part of the paper is devoted to modelling issues. We give some hints how the constraint propagation can be exploited more when solving real-life problems. This part is based on our experience with solving real-life programs and it is also supported by empirical observations of other researchers.},

However, in practice, most of the GIS models are relatively poorly attributed, semantically. Building Information Modeling (BIM) is a process involving the generation and management of digital representations of physical and functional characteristics of building, which is most used in small scale projects. In order to address the target problem of completing the semantic attribution of 3D digital city model, a framework of integrating BIM technology into GIS is demonstrated. A new concept of city information modeling (CIM) is proposed with the goal of bringing great benefits to the urban construction and city management. The composition of city information model is discussed. The data schema behind BIM and GIS (i.e. IFC and CityGML) are compared and mapped with each other. A case study of land planning of campus is demonstrated to present the potential benefits of CIM},

A new material representation model is developed to implicitly describe material usage in a given design domain in terms of one implicit design variable. Based on the KarushKuhnTucker (KKT) necessary conditions, optimality criteria for finding solutions are established and then employed to develop a simple algorithm for one-material minimum mean compliance and compliant mechanism problems. The algorithm consists of sequentially moving iso-surface threshold (MIST) of chosen characteristic response function. Numerical examples are then presented to validate the proposed algorithm MIST for the minimum mean compliance, compliant mechanism, and fully stressed design problems. ?? 2011 Elsevier B.V.

abstract = {This paper presents an optimization algorithm based on Simulated Annealing. The algorithm – denoted as CMLPSA (Corrected Multi-Level & Multi-Point Simulated Annealing) – implements an advanced search mechanism where each candidate design is selected from a population of trial points randomly generated. Therefore, CMLPSA is in principle similar to meta-heuristic algorithms dealing with a pool/population of designs rather than with a single trial point such as it is usually done in classical simulated annealing. The multi-point strategy is adopted for both feasible and infeasible intermediate designs. In the former case, perturbations given to optimization variables are forced to follow the current rate of change exhibited by the cost function. In the latter case, 4th order approximate line search is performed in the neighbourhood of each feasible trial point generated in the current annealing cycle. Furthermore, CMLPSA includes a multi-level annealing strategy where trial points are generated by perturbing all design variables simultaneously (global level) or one by one (local level). Global or local search is performed basing on the current trend seen in the optimization process. CMLPSA is tested in six structural optimization problems where the objective is to minimize the weight of bar trusses – with up to 200 elements – subject to constraints on nodal displacements, member stresses and critical buckling loads. Test cases include both sizing and lay-out optimization variables. The computationally most expensive problem has 200 design variables and 3500 optimization constraints. CMLPSA is compared with other state-of-the-art SA algorithms and advanced global optimization methods like Heuristic Particle Swarm Optimization (HPSO) and Harmony Search (HS) recently presented in literature. Numerical results clearly demonstrate efficiency and robustness of CMLPSA. In particular, CMLPSA found better designs than the other SA-based algorithms and converged much more quickly to the optimum than HPSO and HS. Furthermore, CMLPSA is insensitive to initial design.},

The main contractor on the project developed BIM-enabled tools to allow site workers using mobile tablet personal computers to access design information and to capture work quality and progress data on-site. Accounts show that ‘Site BIM', while judged to be successful and actively supporting users, was delivered through an exploratory and emergent development process of informal prototyping.

abstract = {The paper proposes a new simulated annealing (SA) based multiobjective optimization algorithm, called orthogonal simulated annealing (OSA) algorithm in this work. The OSA algorithm incorporates an orthogonal experiment design (OED) with a simulated annealing based multiobjective algorithm aiming to provide an efficient multiobjective algorithm. OED involves several experiments based on an orthogonal table and a fractional factorial analysis to extract intelligently the best combination of decision vectors making the classical SA to explore search space effectively, to enhance convergence, and to improve quality of solutions in the Pareto set. These benefits have been tested by comparing the performance of OSA with one state-of-the-art multiobjective evolutionary algorithm (NSGA2) and one classical simulated annealing based multiobjective algorithm (CMOSA) considering multiobjective problems of varying degrees of complexity. The obtained Pareto sets by these three algorithms have been tested using standard methods like measure C, hypervolume comparison, etc. Simulation results show that the performance of and CPU time required by these algorithms are problem dependent, and with some problems, the OSA algorithm outperforms the other two algorithms. In particular, the comparison between OSA and CMOSA suggests that around 70% times OSA outperforms CMOSA and obtains a well diversified set of solutions. In addition, with some problems, OSA captures the Pareto fronts where CMOSA fails. Therefore, the development of OSA is noteworthy, and it provides an additional tool to solve multiobjective optimization problems. ?? Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract = {The architectural layout design problem, which is concerned with the finding of the best adjacencies between functional spaces among many possible ones under given constraints, can be formulated as a combinatorial optimization problem and can be solved with an Evolutionary Algorithm (EA). We present functional spaces and their adjacencies in form of graphs and propose an EA called EvoArch that works with a graph-encoding scheme. EvoArch encodes topological configuration in the adjacency matrices of the graphs that they represent and its reproduction operators operate on these adjacency matrices. In order to explore the large search space of graph topologies, these reproduction operators are designed to be unbiased so that all nodes in a graph have equal chances of being selected to be swapped or mutated. To evaluate the fitness of a graph, EvoArch makes use of a fitness function that takes into consideration preferences for adjacencies between different functional spaces, budget and other design constraints. By means of different experiments, we show that EvoArch can be a very useful tool for architectural layout design tasks. {\textcopyright} 2009 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {Many different techniques for measuring material appearance have been proposed in the last few years. These have produced large public datasets, which have been used for accurate, data-driven appearance modeling. However, although these datasets have allowed us to reach an unprecedented level of realism in visual appearance, editing the captured data remains a challenge. In this paper, we present an intuitive control space for predictable editing of captured BRDF data, which allows for artistic creation of plausible novel material appearances, bypassing the difficulty of acquiring novel samples. We first synthesize novel materials, extending the existing MERL dataset up to 400 mathematically valid BRDFs. We then design a large-scale experiment, gathering 56,000 subjective ratings on the high-level perceptual attributes that best describe our extended dataset of materials. Using these ratings, we build and train networks of radial basis functions to act as functionals mapping the perceptual attributes to an underlying PCA-based representation of BRDFs. We show that our functionals are excellent predictors of the perceived attributes of appearance. Our control space enables many applications, including intuitive material editing of a wide range of visual properties, guidance for gamut mapping, analysis of the correlation between perceptual attributes, or novel appearance similarity metrics. Moreover, our methodology can be used to derive functionals applicable to classic analytic BRDF representations. We release our code and dataset publicly, in order to support and encourage further research in this direction.},

In this paper, we design a deep-learning framework that combines convolution operations on graph data with recurrent neural networks to solve the short-term traffic data forecasting problem. The proposed model takes into account recent, daily, and weekly periodic time series to capture different patterns in traffic flow. The experimental study of the model conducted on publicly available real-world datasets shows that the proposed model outperforms other baseline methods.},

This unique volume challenges the reader to tackle all these complex questions and more.Algorithmic Architecture is not a typical theory-based architectural book; it is not a computer programming or language tutorial book either. It contains a series of provocative design projects, and yet it is not just a design or graphic art book per se. Following the tradition of architecture as a conglomeration of various design fields - engineering, theory, art, and recently, computation - the challenge of this book is to present a concept that, like architecture, is a unifying theme for many diverse disciplines. An algorithm is not only a step-by-step problem-solving procedure, a series of lines of computer codes or a mechanistic linguistic expression, but is also an ontological construct with deep philosophical, social, design, and artistic repercussions. Consequently, this book presents many, various and often seemingly disparate points of view that lead to the establishment of one common theme; algorithmic architecture. Guides readers in the increasingly popular practice of using algorithms to solve complex design issues Demonstrates a technique used by many of the big name architecture firms, now cascading down to educational level Shows architects how to use algorithms to go beyond the mouse and transcend the factory set limitations of current 3D CAD software},

Two recently developed heuristic search techniques, simulated annealing and tabu search, are used to solve the large combinatorial optimization problem. The effectiveness and flexibility of these two techniques are evaluated and compared with simple grid search and descent search, using preliminary results from one-dimensional examples. Among the techniques examined in this paper, tabu search performs extremely well in terms of the total number of function evaluations required.},

abstract = {Twitter is generating a large amount of real-time data in the form of microblogs that has potential knowledge for various applications like traffic incident analysis and urban planning. Social media data represents the unbiased actual insights of citizens' concerns that may be mined in making cities smarter. In this study, a computational framework has been proposed using word embedding and machine learning model to detect traffic incidents using social media data. The study includes the feasibility of using machine learning algorithms with different feature extraction and representation models for the identification of traffic incidents from the Twitter interactions. The comprehensive proposed approach is the combination of following four steps. In the first phase, a dictionary of traffic-related keywords is formed. Secondly, real-time Twitter data has been collected using the dictionary of identified traffic related keywords. In the third step, collected tweets have been pre-processed, and the feature generation model is applied to convert the dataset eligible for a machine learning classifier. Further, a machine learning model is trained and tested to identify the tweets containing traffic incidents. The results of the study show that machine learning models built on top of right feature extraction strategy is very promising to identify the tweets containing traffic incidents from micro-blogs.},

abstract = {Because of their effectiveness in broad practical applications, LSTM networks have received a wealth of coverage in scientific journals, technical blogs, and implementation guides. However, in most articles, the inference formulas for the LSTM network and its parent, RNN, are stated axiomatically, while the training formulas are omitted altogether. In addition, the technique of “unrolling” an RNN is routinely presented without justification throughout the literature. The goal of this tutorial is to explain the essential RNN and LSTM fundamentals in a single document. Drawing from concepts in Signal Processing, we formally derive the canonical RNN formulation from differential equations. We then propose and prove a precise statement, which yields the RNN unrolling technique. We also review the difficulties with training the standard RNN and address them by transforming the RNN into the “Vanilla LSTM”1 network through a series of logical arguments. We provide all equations pertaining to the LSTM system together with detailed descriptions of its constituent entities. Albeit unconventional, our choice of notation and the method for presenting the LSTM system emphasizes ease of understanding. As part of the analysis, we identify new opportunities to enrich the LSTM system and incorporate these extensions into the Vanilla LSTM network, producing the most general LSTM variant to date. The target reader has already been exposed to RNNs and LSTM networks through numerous available resources and is open to an alternative pedagogical approach. A Machine Learning practitioner seeking guidance for implementing our new augmented LSTM model in software for experimentation and research will find the insights and derivations in this treatise valuable as well.},

abstract = {Purpose – The purpose of this paper is to address the problem in research of a lack of a holistic conceptual framework related to incremental and discontinuous innovation. Too often, the term “innovation” is used without an understanding of how it can be applied in a product design and supply chain fulfillment system. In this study, the goal is to develop a holistic “innovation continuum” to treat innovation as a complex adaptive system (CAS). Design/methodology/approach – A comprehensive literature review was conducted, and from it, four propositions and a conceptual framework were developed. Findings – The authors determined that an “innovation continuum” can be established through the use of a complex adaptive system. Two, incremental innovation is determined to possess adaptive qualities, and can be enhanced through the use of collaboration and evolutionary algorithms. Three, discontinuous innovation is established as a creative process enabled through expert designers, and improved through the use of generative design. Next, a supply chain system for incremental innovation can be assisted by the use of adaptive systems, but it is not proven that a generative customization system (for discontinuous innovation) can be improved through the use of a CAS. Originality/value – The paper has established an “innovation continuum” linking incremental and discontinuous innovation within one holistic system. It establishes the use of evolutionary algorithms to improve the viability of incremental innovation, and generative design for discontinuous innovation. Finally, the concept of generative customization as an end to end product design and supply chain fulfillment solution for discontinuous innovation is established.},

abstract = {Recently, GPS car navigation became popular enough for a significant number of drivers in any large city to be able to potentially send their current GPS positions and velocities to a central traffic-managing server in real time. This data could be used to reconstruct a map of current traffic in the whole city and make predictions for the future, which would be valuable for traffic control, congestion analysis and prevention. The difficulty lying in the traffic reconstruction problem is that the number of cars equipped with a GPS transmitter is a small in comparison with the total number of cars in the road network. Information obtained from GPS transmitters is therefore rare and incomplete, raising the problem of approximating travel velocities from sparse information. In this context, the paper proposes approaches to solving two problems: (1) of reconstruction of routes of the individual cars in a street graph from a temporal stream of its coordinates and (2) of approximating the average velocity on a given street from irregular time series of instantaneous velocities of cars passing through that street. Determining the car's position in the road network is quite expensive computationally when done in a naive way, so we propose a method to speed up the car's localization based on the R-tree data structure [10]. Additionally, a resilient propagation neural network [13] is applied to approximate the average velocity on any edge of a street graph. Our methods were applied to one of the problems announced in the competition organized in June 2010 by Tom-Tom - a company producing automotive navigation systems [15]. The results of experiments show the capacity of our approach to make useful predictions.},

abstract = {Cities are becoming increasingly complex to manage, as they increase in size and must provide higher living standards for their populations. New technology-based solutions must be developed towards attending this growth and ensuring that it is socially sustainable. This paper puts forward the notion that these solutions must share some properties: they should be anthropocentric, holistic, horizontal, multi-dimensional, multi-modal, and predictive. We propose an architecture in which streaming data sources that characterize the city context are used to feed a real-time graph of the city's assets and states, as well as to train predictive models that hint into near future states of the city. This allows human decision-makers and automated services to take decisions, both for the present and for the future. To achieve this, multiple data sources about a city were gradually connected to a message broker, that enables increasingly rich decision-support. Results show that it is possible to predict future states of a city, in aspects such as traffic, air pollution, and other ambient variables. The key innovative aspect of this work is that, as opposed to the majority of existing approaches which focus on a real-time view of the city, we also provide insights into the near-future state of the city, thus allowing city services to plan ahead and adapt accordingly. The main goal is to optimize decision-making by anticipating future states of the city and make decisions accordingly.},

First, we wish to bring to the attention of the Industrial Engineering community a challenging industrial problem, black-box structural design, which cannot currently be satisfactorily addressed by professional software for topology optimization. The constraint functions considered here are non-linear and implicit, their evaluation requires the resolution of a computation-intensive finite-element analysis performed by a black-box commercial structural mechanics software such as MSC/Nastran. We present here a brief overview of topology optimization methods. Secondly, we propose a practical topology design heuristic methodology for handling such problems, which includes a new interpolation scheme for the fictive-material SIMP model.

abstract = {Lisp is the world's greatest programming language—or so its proponents think. The structure of Lispmakes it easy to extend the language or even to implement entirely new dialects without starting from scratch. Overall, the evolution of Lisp has been guided more by institutional rivalry, one-upsmanship, and the glee born of technical cleverness that is characteristic of the “hacker culture” than by sober assessments of technical requirements. Nevertheless this process has eventually produced both an industrial- strength programming language, messy but powerful, and a technically pure dialect, small but powerful, that is suitable for use by programming-language theoreticians. We pick up where McCarthy's paper in the first HOPL conference left off. We trace the development chronologically from the era of the PDP-6, through the heyday of Interlisp and MacLisp, past the ascension and decline of special purpose Lisp machines, to the present era of standardization activities. We then examine the technical evolution of a few representative language features, including both some notable successes and some notable failures, that illuminate design issues that distinguish Lisp from other programming languages. We also discuss the use of Lisp as a laboratory for designing other programming languages. We conclude with some reflections on the forces that have driven the evolution of Lisp.},

abstract = {Online vehicle routing is an important task of the modern transportation service provider. Contributed by the ever-increasing real-time demand on the transportation system, especially small-parcel last-mile delivery requests, vehicle route generation is becoming more computationally complex than before. The existing routing algorithms are mostly based on mathematical programming, which requires huge computation time in city-size transportation networks. To develop routes with minimal time, in this paper, we propose a novel deep reinforcement learning-based neural combinatorial optimization strategy. Specifically, we transform the online routing problem to a vehicle tour generation problem, and propose a structural graph embedded pointer network to develop these tours iteratively. Furthermore, since constructing supervised training data for the neural network is impractical due to the high computation complexity, we propose a deep reinforcement learning mechanism with an unsupervised auxiliary network to train the model parameters. A multisampling scheme is also devised to further improve the system performance. Since the parameter training process is offline, the proposed strategy can achieve a superior online route generation speed. To assess the proposed strategy, we conduct comprehensive case studies with a real-world transportation network.

For this purpose, we apply the DCCA cross-correlation coefficient ($\rho$DCCA) between the country stock market index and their respective blue-chips. Then, with the cross-correlation coefficient, we qualify and quantify how each blue-chip is adherent to its country index, evaluating the type of cross-correlation among them. Subsequently, for each blue-chip, we propose to study the 2008 financial crisis by measuring the adherence between post and pre-crisis. From this analysis, we can construct an adhesion map of each company with respect to the global index. Our database is formed of 12 Eurozone countries.},

abstract = {This paper studies the influence of architectural education and early experience of the work of a group pf architects, whose work shows strong features of bioclimatic integration (such as Lele and Severiano Porto in Brazil and Spencer de Grey and Mario Cucinella in Europe). The first analysis of their individual experiences, through semi-structured interviews, indicates that the integration of bioclimatic concepts into design is beyond the development or improvement of tools. First of all, it is fundamental that these concepts are part of the design philosophy of the professional, which is determinant on the application of research and innovation in architectural practice. Therefore, before the tools, the formal education can be a tool to promote the inclusion of these principles as part of their design philosophy, influencing the approach to design. It happened in the cases in which there was a commitment of the school to develop a technical knowledge basis in building physics into studio activities, highlighting the aesthetic character of environmental integration. This basis was consolidated in the contact with the building site construction, which also strengthened their ethical commitment regarding the quality of the built object. It has the potential to generate confidence in the consideration of these issues, also making it easier to get the right information from available resources and tools, via a critical understanding of the different issues.},

abstract = {In this paper, four simulated annealing based multiobjective algorithms - SMOSA, UMOSA, PSA and WMOSA have been used to solve multiobjective optimization of constrained problems with varying degree of complexity along with a new PDMOSA algorithm. PDMOSA algorithm uses a strategy of Pareto dominant based fitness in the acceptance criteria of simulated annealing and is improved. In all algorithms, the current solution explores its neighborhoods in a way similar to that of classical simulated annealing. The performance and computational cost for all algorithms have been studied. All algorithms are found to be quite robust with algorithmic parameters and are capable of generating a large number of well diversified Pareto-optimal solutions. The quality and diversification of Pareto-optimal solutions generated by all algorithms are found to be problem specific. The computational cost is least by WMOSA and is followed by PDMOSA. The algorithms are simple to formulate and require reasonable computational time. Hence, the simultaneous use of all algorithms is suggested to obtain a wider spectrum of efficient solutions. ?? 2004 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

Lack of such a comprehensive decision-making framework which utilizes BIM, Management Information Systems (MIS), simulation, and automation tools to choose between different construction alternatives have been addressed in the research background. As an example of decision-making objective, optimized smart building's equipment combination for a certain project should be selected in the feasibility study phase. In this research, a comprehensive decision-making framework was developed to choose smart building's equipment based on energy consumption and cost trade-off. Subsequently, smart building alternatives were considered as a decision-making example to choose the best alternative using BIM, MIS and simulation tools. The research contributes to the automating of some parts of the decision-making framework by developing an Application Programming Interface (API). This API helps with making the appropriate automating permutation out of possible options, totalizing the cost of each combination and sorting data in the research database developed for the recommended framework. This framework, database and API can be used similarly for any other decision making objective. Finally, a model representing the average conditions of residential buildings in Tehran was developed to choose the optimized smart building's equipment combination of 31 considered options. This optimized combination which included all possible smart building options except for smart lighting has an investment return of about 7.5 years which is more than that of similar projects in other countries due to Iran's low energy carrier tariff.},

abstract = {Traffic prediction has drawn increasing attention for its ubiquitous real-life applications in traffic management, urban computing, public safety, and so on. Recently, the availability of massive trajectory data and the success of deep learning motivate a plethora of deep traffic prediction studies. However, the existing neural-network-based approaches tend to ignore the correlations between multiple types of moving objects located in the same spatio-temporal traffic area, which is suboptimal for traffic prediction analytics. In this paper, we propose a multi-source deep traffic prediction framework over spatio-temporal trajectory data, termed as MDTP. The framework includes two phases: spatio-temporal feature modeling and multi-source bridging. We present an enhanced graph convolutional network (GCN) model combined with long short-term memory network (LSTM) to capture the spatial dependencies and temporal dynamics of traffic in the feature modeling phase. In the multi-source bridging phase, we propose two methods, Sum and Concat, to connect the learned features from different trajectory data sources. Extensive experiments on two real-life datasets show that MDTP i) has superior efficiency, compared with classical time-series methods, machine learning methods, and state-of-the-art neural-network-based approaches; ii) offers a significant performance improvement over the single-source traffic prediction approach; and iii) performs traffic predictions in seconds even on tens of millions of trajectory data. we develop MDTP+, a user-friendly interactive system to demonstrate traffic prediction analysis.},

We argue that such differentiation cannot be achieved with conventional Building Information Modelling and without customizing existing software. We compare the case studies' PD approaches (objected-oriented programming, functional programming, visual programming and distributed visual programming) and decomposition, algorithms and data structures as crucial factors for the practical viability of complex parametric models and as key aspects of PD thinking.},

Real-time region-level traffic prediction help city traffic managers with traffic demand analysis, traffic congestion control, and other activities, and it has become a research hotspot. As more vehicles are equipped with GPS devices, remote sensing data can be collected and used to conduct data-driven region-level-based traffic prediction. However, due to dynamism and randomness of urban traffic and the complexity of urban road networks, the study of such issues faces many challenges. This paper proposes a new deep learning model named TmS-GCN to predict region-level traffic information, which is composed of Graph Convolutional Network (GCN) and Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU). The GCN part captures spatial dependence among regions, while the GRU part captures the dynamic change of traffic within the region. Model verification and comparison are carried out using real taxi GPS data from Shenzhen. The experimental results show that the proposed model outperforms both the classic time series prediction model and the deep learning model at different scales.},

Although many policies in China have been issued to promote construction waste management, unfortunately there is no significant effect, and the key is lack of a quantitative evaluation system and guidance on management level. Based on the domestic and foreign relevant experiences, this paper puts forward a new system to evaluate waste management performance in an architectural engineering project. Through research, main influence factors of construction waste management in our country are confirmed, namely: “commitment of contractor's representative on site; collecting packed materials back by suppliers; minimizing rework in the construction phase; design and construction using standardized materials; and appointment of laborers solely for waste disposal”. Through four construction cases in the Pearl River Delta with the application of performance assessment model of waste management in architectural engineering projects, it is proved that the model can effectively measure the waste management performance in construction site, with clearer responsibilities and higher performance. Finally, it is suggested that our government should assess waste management performance in construction site pertinently, develop market assessment software actively, and promote the environmental sustainable development of architectural industry.},

In these fields, interdisciplinary research in GIScience and related fields is needed to support the modelling, analysis, management, and integration of large geo-referenced data sets, which describe human activities and geophysical phenomena. Geo-databases may serve as platforms to integrate 2D maps, 3D geo-scientific models, and other geo-referenced data. However, current geo-databases do not provide sufficient 3D data modelling and data handling techniques. New 3D geo-databases are needed to handle surface and volume models. This article first presents a 25-year retrospective of geo-database research. Data modelling, standards, and indexing of geo-data are discussed in detail. New directions for the development of 3D geo-databases to open new fields for interdisciplinary research are addressed. Two scenarios in the fields of early warning and emergency response demonstrate the combined management of human and geophysical phenomena.

We report a method of generating a “mobility-index” and a “stay-at-home/resting-index” based on aggregated anonymous Call Detail Records of almost all subscribers in Hungary, which tracks all phones, examining their strengths and weaknesses, comparing it with Community Mobility Reports from Google, limited to smartphone data. The impact of policy changes, such as school closures, could be identified with sufficient granularity to capture a rush to shops prior to imposition of restrictions. Anecdotal reports of large scale movement of Hungarians to holiday homes were confirmed. At the national level, our results correlated well with Google mobility data, but there were some differences at weekends and national holidays, which can be explained by methodological differences. Mobile phones offer a means to analyse population movement but there are several technical and privacy issues. Overcoming these, our method is a practical and inexpensive way forward, achieving high levels of accuracy and resolution, especially where uptake of smartphones is modest, although it is not an alternative to smartphone-based solutions used for contact tracing and quarantine monitoring.},

abstract = {With the rapid development of mobile-internet technologies, on-demand ride-sourcing services have become increasingly popular and largely reshaped the way people travel. Demand prediction is one of the most fundamental components in supply-demand management systems of ride-sourcing platforms. With an accurate short-term prediction for origin-destination (OD) demand, the platforms make precise and timely decisions on real-time matching, idle vehicle reallocations, and ride-sharing vehicle routing, etc. Compared to the zone-based demand prediction that has been examined in many previous studies, OD-based demand prediction is more challenging. This is mainly due to the complicated spatial and temporal dependencies among the demand of different OD pairs. To overcome this challenge, we propose the Spatio-Temporal Encoder-Decoder Residual Multi-Graph Convolutional network (ST-ED-RMGC), a novel deep learning model for predicting ride-sourcing demand of various OD pairs. Firstly, the model constructs OD graphs, which utilize adjacent matrices to characterize the non-Euclidean pair-wise geographical and semantic correlations among different OD pairs. Secondly, based on the constructed graphs, a residual multi-graph convolutional (RMGC) network is designed to encode the contextual-aware spatial dependencies, and a long-short term memory (LSTM) network is used to encode the temporal dependencies, into a dense vector space. Finally, we reuse the RMGC networks to decode the compressed vector back to OD graphs and predict the future OD demand. Through extensive experiments on the for-hire-vehicles datasets in Manhattan, New York City, we show that our proposed deep learning framework outperforms the state-of-arts by a significant margin.},

This analysis took into account the BREXIT referendum, on the 23rd of June 2016 and the entire period was partitioned in two periods, before and after the BREXIT referendum. First of all, we applied the Detrended Fluctuation Analysis method (with the regular and with a sliding windows approach)in order to evaluate market efficiency. In this case, we found that in general the referendum did not change efficiency levels significantly. With the main purpose of measuring the markets interdependence in relation to the UK index, following the referendum, we calculated the $\Delta$$\rho$DCCA coefficient. Our results point to a decrease in the cross-correlation coefficient ($\Delta$$\rho$DCCA<0), meaning that the UK is more segmented now, in relation to other EU partners, than in the past. With $\Delta$$\rho$DCCA it was possible to identify how much the referendum influenced the interdependence, but not the efficiency, of European markets.},

abstract = {In this study, we first build two empirical cross-correlation matrices in the US stock market by two different methods, namely the Pearson's correlation coefficient and the detrended cross-correlation coefficient (DCCA coefficient). Then, combining the two matrices with the method of random matrix theory (RMT), we mainly investigate the statistical properties of cross-correlations in the US stock market. We choose the daily closing prices of 462 constituent stocks of S&P 500 index as the research objects and select the sample data from January 3, 2005 to August 31, 2012. In the empirical analysis, we examine the statistical properties of cross-correlation coefficients, the distribution of eigenvalues, the distribution of eigenvector components, and the inverse participation ratio. From the two methods, we find some new results of the cross-correlations in the US stock market in our study, which are different from the conclusions reached by previous studies. The empirical cross-correlation matrices constructed by the DCCA coefficient show several interesting properties at different time scales in the US stock market, which are useful to the risk management and optimal portfolio selection, especially to the diversity of the asset portfolio. It will be an interesting and meaningful work to find the theoretical eigenvalue distribution of a completely random matrix R for the DCCA coefficient because it does not obey the Mar{\v{c}}enko-Pastur distribution. {\textcopyright} 2013 Elsevier B.V.

abstract = {The evolutionary structural optimisation (ESO) method has been under continuous development since 1992. Traditionally, the method was conceived from the engineering perspective that the topology and shape of structures were naturally conservative for safety reasons and therefore contained an excess of material. To move from the conservative design to a more optimum design would therefore involve the removal of material. Thus the ESO method started from a design space much bigger than the optimum and the final topology or shape emerged by a process of removal of unwanted/inefficient/lowly stresses material. The original algorithms allowed for two forms of evolution. One was there the understressed material could be removed from anywhere in the allowable design space, and with compensation for checker-boarding this produces an optimum topology under the prescribed environments. The second form only allows removal from the surface or parts of the surface (called nibbling in the ESO lexicon); this produces a Min-Max situation where the maximum surface stress is reduced to a minimum. It has been demonstrated that the ESO process produces a surface that is an iso-stress contour thus satisfying the Min-Max optimality criterion. The present paper addresses the opposite evolutionary process whereby the structure evolves from a base which is the minimum structural form required to carry the load regardless of the magnitude of the stress levels. Material is added in the proximity of high stress to ameliorate its effect and hence the final structural form emerges. Only singly connected regions are formed in the present analysis and thus the additive ESO process is the opposite of the nibbling SO, mentioned above, that produces optimum surface shapes. The paper presents a brief background to the current state of structural optimisation research. This is followed by a discussion of the strategies for the additive ESO (AESO) algorithm and two examples are presented.},

abstract = {The development of smart cities and their fast-paced deployment is resulting in the generation of large quantities of data at unprecedented rates. Unfortunately, most of the generated data is wasted without extracting potentially useful information and knowledge because of the lack of established mechanisms and standards that benefit from the availability of such data. Moreover, the high dynamical nature of smart cities calls for new generation of machine learning approaches that are flexible and adaptable to cope with the dynamicity of data to perform analytics and learn from real-time data. In this article, we shed the light on the challenge of under utilizing the big data generated by smart cities from a machine learning perspective. Especially, we present the phenomenon of wasting unlabeled data. We argue that semi-supervision is a must for smart city to address this challenge. We also propose a three-level learning framework for smart cities that matches the hierarchical nature of big data generated by smart cities with a goal of providing different levels of knowledge abstractions. The proposed framework is scalable to meet the needs of smart city services. Fundamentally, the framework benefits from semi-supervised deep reinforcement learning where a small amount of data that has users' feedback serves as labeled data while a larger amount is without such users' feedback serves as unlabeled data. This paper also explores how deep reinforcement learning and its shift toward semi-supervision can handle the cognitive side of smart city services and improve their performance by providing several use cases spanning the different domains of smart cities. We also highlight several challenges as well as promising future research directions for incorporating machine learning and high-level intelligence into smart city services.},

However, in the early design stages, when the envelope shape is defined, energy performance information is normally nonexistent, due to modeling for energy simulation being a time-consuming task, frequently overlooked at this phase. This paper presents a methodology to assist design decisions regarding the building envelope shape considering its implications on energy performance. Basically, this methodology involves a flexible design system, to generate alternative envelope shape designs, with integrated energy simulation, to calculate the energy demand of each design. Shape grammars are particularly suitable to encode architectural design systems, given their ability to encode compositional design principles. Their downside is the complexity in developing computer implementations. This methodology converts a grammar into a parametric design system and is illustrated with an application to the grammar for Frank Lloyd Wright's prairie houses. {\textcopyright} 2012 Elsevier B.V.

abstract = {There are building systems, called "modularized", in which the component systems (for structure, lighting, etc) can be analyzed and synthesized independently since their performance and design do not interact or affect one another. There are other building systems, called "coupled", in which the component systems do interact and influence one another. The thesis acknowledges that in a building there are both sub-systems that act independently and others that interact. While many design processes have been proposed for dealing with discrete sub-systems, there is no systematic study for building sub-systems that interrelate. This thesis examines a different design approach called integrated. The term "integrated" has a dual utilization in this study. The first use refers to the integration of form and building performance. The second use refers to the integration of interrelated and diverse building performances involving multiple disciplines. The integrated design approach analyzes and evaluates several interrelated design systems involving different disciplines in the early design phase. The goal of the approach is the generation of design alternatives guided simultaneously by two basic objectives: the aspiration for form exploration and the satisfaction of the performances of interrelated systems. After defining a framework for an integrated design approach, which includes inter-disciplinary collaboration, unified design, optimization, simulation, and other formal and digital techniques, the approach will be demonstrated in a case study. The objective of the case study is to demonstrate that the integrated design approach has validity and can be realized, in this case, for the generation of high-rise buildings guided by structural, lighting, zoning codes, and aesthetic criteria.},

Building on these previous studies, we here test the hypothesis that the technological and market strategies of a new entrant are highly interrelated and that their joint effect plays an important role in a firm's probability of survival. In particular, we propose that firms that target new market segments with an architectural innovation will tend to be more successful than those that target existing markets or innovate in component technology, even after controlling for all the competing predictors of survival. This paper advances the existing literature on innovation by tracing the main technical elements of a dominant design in the rigid disk drive industry over time, and provides a much more rigorous definition of the concept of a dominant design than we have had in the past. We find the notion of first-mover advantage is not applicable in the rigid disk drive industry. Instead, we propose the idea of an entry-window tightly linked to the emergence of the dominant product design as defined.},

abstract = {The need for more sustainable, liveable and resilient cities demands improved methods for studying urban infrastructures as integrated wholes. Progress in this direction would be aided by the ability to effectively reuse and integrate existing computational models of urban systems. Building on the concept of multi-model ecologies, this paper describes ongoing efforts to facilitate model reuse and integration in the Holistic Urban Energy Simulation (HUES) platform - an extendable simulation environment for the study of urban multi-energy systems. We describe the design and development of a semantic wiki as part of the HUES platform. The purpose of this wiki is to enable the sharing and navigation of model metadata – essential information about the models and datasets of the platform. Each model and dataset in the platform is represented in the wiki in a structured way to facilitate the identification of opportunities for model reuse and integration. As the platform grows, this will help to ensure that it develops coherently and makes efficient use of existing formalized knowledge. We present the core concepts of multi-model ecologies and semantic wikis, the current state of the platform and associated wiki, and a case study demonstrating their use and benefit.},

abstract = {Construction site layout planning has been recognized as a critical step in construction planning. The basic function of this process is to find the best arrangement of the temporary facilities according to multiple objectives that may conflict with each other and subjected to logical and resource constraints. The formulation of the construction site layout planning problem as an optimization problem turns out to be a nonlinear programming problem where there are conflicting multi-objectives to be achieved. It is shown that the swarm intelligence based meta-heuristic algorithms are quite powerful in obtaining the solution of such hard to solve type of optimization problems. In this study a multi objective artificial bee colony (MOABC) via Levy flights algorithm is proposed to determine the optimum construction site layout. The model is intended to optimize the dynamic layout of unequal-area under two objective functions. The performance of MOABC with Levy flights is demonstrated on a real benchmark construction engineering of construction site layout planning problem and the optimum solution obtained is compared with the one determined by the ant colony algorithm.},

@article{Hochreiter1997,
abstract = {Learning to store information over extended time intervals by recurrent backpropagation takes a very long time, mostly because of insufficient, decaying error backflow. We briefly review Hochreiter's (1991) analysis of this problem, then address it by introducing a novel, efficient, gradient-based method called long short-term memory (LSTM). Truncating the gradient where this does not do harm, LSTM can learn to bridge minimal time lags in excess of 1000 discrete-time steps by enforcing constant error flow through constant error carousels within special units. Multiplicative gate units learn to open and close access to the constant error flow. LSTM is local in space and time; its computational complexity per time step and weight is O(1). Our experiments with artificial data involve local, distributed, real-valued, and noisy pattern representations. In comparisons with real-time recurrent learning, back propagation through time, recurrent cascade correlation, Elman nets, and neural sequence chunking, LSTM leads to many more successful runs, and learns much faster. LSTM also solves complex, artificial long-time-lag tasks that have never been solved by previous recurrent network algorithms.},

abstract = {Most of the existing methods for dam behavior modeling require a persistent set of input parameters. In real-world applications, failures of the measuring equipment can lead to a situation in which a selected model becomes unusable because of the volatility of the independent variables set. This paper presents an adaptive system for dam behavior modeling that is based on a multiple linear regression (MLR) model and is optimized for given conditions using genetic algorithms (GA). Throughout an evolutionary process, the system performs real-time adjustment of regressors in the MLR model according to currently active sensors. The performance of the proposed system has been evaluated in a case study of modeling the Bocac dam (at the Vrbas River located in the Republic of Srpska), whereby an MLR model of the dam displacements has been optimized for periods when the sensors were malfunctioning. Results of the analysis have shown that, under real-world circumstances, the proposed methodology outperforms traditional regression approaches. ?? 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

The initial modification of BESO method is to allow for inefficient Material Element String (MES) to be removed while efficient MES to be added in the thickness direction of a composite structure. This modification can reduce the chance of high stress concentration in a composite structure and also produce the geometry which is easy to fabricate using fabrication techniques currently available. The results of a cantilever composite laminate under uniform inplane pressure are presented, showing that the proposed method can produce shape and topology for composite structures with optimal structure stiffness.},

However, as the graph increases in complexity it quickly becomes inflexible and unsuitable for exploring a wide design space. By contrast, implicit low-level rule systems can offer wide design exploration due to their lack of structure, but often act as black boxes to human observers with only initial conditions and final designs cognisable. In response to these two extremes, the authors propose a new approach called Meta-Parametric Design, combining graph-based parametric modelling with genetic programming. The advantages of this approach are demonstrated using two real case-study projects that widen design exploration whilst maintaining the benefits of a graph representation.},

The aim is to find the stiffest structure with a certain amount of material, based on the element's contribution to the strain energy. The ACO algorithm provides a suitable tool to handle the problem as an on-off discrete optimization. In this method, the analogy with ants determining the shortest path to food is the decision for an element to be eliminated or to remain. The main effect of using this approach lies in the fact that the problems of topology optimization can be reformulated as discrete problems with no limitation.

The basic operational principles of various schemes under the six categories of inverters are presented and compared in terms of leakage current, efficiency, strengths and weaknesses. Furthermore, the proposed inverter structure and a compensation strategy for eliminating leakage current have been discussed followed by a comparative study with the available ones. Consequently, our proposed system has found noteworthy results in PSIM environment with a reduction in leakage current as compared with those in three other different topologies.},

abstract = {Nowadays, legacy electrical distribution systems are migrating to a new modern electric grid with the capability of supporting different applications such as advanced metering infrastructure (AMI), distributed energy resources, and electric vehicles. Among these applications, AMI is playing an important role in delivering data from customers to power utilities, supporting reliable real-time monitoring, and remote operation of power quality data and voltage profile. The AMI consists of smart meters, data aggregation points (DAPs), the utility control center, and communication networks. Appropriate network planning plays an essential role in facilitating the exchange of data between consumers and power utilities as well as accommodating new smart grid applications and future growth. This work proposes an optimal placement of DAPs for AMI based on machine learning clustering techniques in residential grids. Network partitioning is introduced to create sub-networks and graph algorithms generate a deployment topology given optimization constraints. A new measurement metric called coverage density is considered to indicate neighborhood area networks (NAN) zones with the appropriate coverage. Three real scenarios of NAN are considered: urban, suburban, and rural. The proposed algorithm is evaluated and compared with conventional heuristic optimization methods with respect to average and maximum distance between smart meters and DAPs, coverage density, and execution time.},

abstract = {Short-term traffic forecasting on large street networks is significant in transportation and urban management, such as real-time route guidance and congestion alleviation. Nevertheless, it is very challenging to obtain high prediction accuracy with reasonable computational cost due to the complex spatial dependency on the traffic network and the time-varying traffic patterns. To address these issues, this paper develops a residual graph convolution long short-term memory (RGC-LSTM) model for spatial-temporal data forecasting considering the network topology. This model integrates a new graph convolution operator for spatial modelling on networks and a residual LSTM structure for temporal modelling considering multiple periodicities. The proposed model has few parameters, low computational complexity, and a fast convergence rate. The framework is evaluated on both the 10-min traffic speed data from Shanghai, China and the 5-min Caltrans Performance Measurement System (PeMS) traffic flow data. Experiments show the advantages of the proposed approach over various state-of-the-art baselines, as well as consistent performance across different datasets.},

The Action assembled a network involving >30 countries, 23 actively participating cities, researchers, practitioners and urban decision-makers, and brought together the fragmented research and good practice across Europe in sustainable urban sub-surface use. Development of national exemplars has been encouraged, and good practice identified to inspire others, using a lighthouse-follower approach to cascade knowledge and good practice across Europe and further afield. Experts from both sides of the knowledge gap were brought together to assess and synthesise the state-of-the-art in lighthouse cities with respect to urban sub-surface knowledge, understanding, and use of that knowledge. This was achieved in 19 City Studies, with findings encapsulated in an over-view report “Out of Sight - Out of Mind”. Expert sub-groups then identified good practice in subsurface data and knowledge locally, nationally, and Europe-wide. These are highlighted in the synthesis report “Opening up the subsurface for the cities of tomorrow”, and expanded on in seven topic review reports. These also identified key gaps in knowledge, and its use. A new concept, {GEOCIM} is proposed for City Quarter to Conurbation scales, combining subsurface and above-ground models. These enable: a.) holistic urban planning; b.) identifying subsurface opportunities; and c.) saving costs by reducing uncertainty in ground conditions. Finally, the Action's reports and outputs were integrated within an online toolbox, and will be further outlined in the Final Report of the Action, to be made available on the Action's website. The Sub-Urban Toolbox promotes and disseminates the good practice, and decision-support tools: a.) to help better inform and empower city decision- and policy-makers about the sub-surface and the vital importance of its early-stage consideration; and b.) accelerate uptake amongst sub-surface experts of sub-surface modelling workflows. Users with different backgrounds and needs, require different access to, and appropriate translations of, the Sub-Urban Toolbox. Therefore different entry points are provided for sub-surface technical experts, and urban planners, and decision- and policy-makers. As the critical mass of city decision- and policy-makers that is better aware of the sub-surface and its sustainable use expands, the potential for higher level policy consideration of the subsurface grows, and a wider range of impacts will become achievable.},

We believe this formalism has advantages both as a progrmming language and as a vehicle for developing a theory of computation. Next, we describe S-expressions and S-functions, give some examples, and then describe the universal S-function apply which plays the theoretical role fo a universal Turing machine and the practical role of an interpreter. Then we describe the representation of S-expressions in the memory of the IBM 704 by list structures similar to those used by Newell, Shaw and Simon, and the representation of S-functions by program. Then we mention the main features of the LISP programming system for the IBM 704. Next comes another way of describing computations with symbolic expressions, and finally we give a recursive function interpretation of flow charts. We hope to describe some of the symbolic computations for which LISP has been used in another paper, and also to give elsewhere some applications of our recursive function formalism to mathematical logic and to the problem of mechanical theorem proving.},

abstract = {This paper presents a scalable deep learning approach for short-term traffic prediction based on historical traffic data in a vehicular road network. Capturing the spatiooral relationship of the big data often requires a significant amount of computational burden or an ad-hoc design aiming for a specific type of road network. To tackle the problem, we combine a road network graph with recurrent neural networks (RNNs) to construct a structural RNN (SRNN). The SRNN employs a spatiooral graph to infer the interaction between adjacent road segments as well as the temporal dynamics of the time series data. The model is scalable thanks to two key aspects. First, the proposed SRNN architecture is built by using the semantic similarity of the spatiooral dynamic interactions of all segments. Second, we design the architecture to deal with fixed-length tensors regardless of the graph topology. With the real traffic speed data measured in the city of Santander, we demonstrate the proposed SRNN outperforms the image-based approaches using the capsule network (CapsNet) by 14.1% and the convolutional neural network (CNN) by 5.87%, respectively, in terms of root mean squared error (RMSE). Moreover, we show that the proposed model is scalable. The SRNN model trained with data of a road network is able to predict traffic speed of different road networks, with the fixed number of parameters to train.},

In the conventional simulated annealing, the temperature declines constantly, providing the search with a higher transition probability in the beginning of the search and lower probability toward the end of the search. In the first proposed method, an adaptive temperature control scheme is used that changes temperature based on the number of consecutive improving moves. In the second method, a tabu list has been added to the adaptive simulated annealing algorithm in order to avoid revisits. The performance of these two algorithms is evaluated and favorably compared with the conventional simulated annealing.},

abstract = {This chapter discusses the interval methods for shape synthesis and analysis. Interval analysis is used in a variety of algorithms to compute solutions to global problems and is an exhaustive technique as all regions of the problem's input space are examined for solutions. Convergent inclusion functions are a useful tool for the analysis of interval algorithms. The number of solutions to the constraint system is assumed to be the number of disjoint sets produced. This technique may be used heuristically or in combination with the condition for existence of a unique zero. A robust approach to the subproblem of obtaining all solutions to the constraint system is to use a robust test for solution existence in each aggregated region. Interval Newton methods are robust methods to find bounds on the set of zeroes of a system of n equations of n variables and are the interval analogs of multidimensional Newton iteration for the simultaneous solution of nonlinear equations.},

The resulting found geometry consists of purely axial forces under self-weight, with zero bending moment at nodes for both shells and tension net forms. The advantages of this method over known approaches are discussed, with an application on a recent live project also described. A real-time solver using semi-implicit Euler integration with viscous damping is used to achieve system equilibrium. By using a real-time solver, the designer is able to alter the gravitational field or apply new point loads without re-starting the analysis, leading to a interactive experience in generating design options. The successful application of the method on a recent project is also discussed.},

BIMs emerged as a result of a push by the software companies, to tackle the problems of inefficient information exchange between different software and to enable true interoperability. In BIM approach most up-to-date an accurate models of a building are stored in shared central databases during the design and the construction of a project and at post-construction stages. GIS based city monitoring / city management applications require the fusion of information acquired from multiple resources, BIMs, City Models and Sensors. This paper focuses on providing a method for facilitating the GIS based fusion of information residing in digital building “Models” and information acquired from the city objects i.e. “Things”. Once this information fusion is accomplished, many fields ranging from Emergency Response, Urban Surveillance, Urban Monitoring to Smart Buildings will have potential benefits.},

@article{Tyrovolas2021,
abstract = {Background: On January 21, 2020, the World Health Organization reported the first case of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2, which rapidly evolved to the COVID-19 pandemic. Since then, the virus has also rapidly spread among Latin American, Caribbean, and African countries. Objective: The first aim of this study is to identify new emerging COVID-19 clusters over time and space (from January 21 to mid-May 2020) in Latin American, Caribbean, and African regions, using a prospective space–time scan measurement approach. The second aim is to assess the impact of real-time population mobility patterns between January 21 and May 18, 2020, under the implemented government interventions, measurements, and policy restrictions on COVID-19 spread among those regions and worldwide. Methods: We created a global COVID-19 database, of 218 countries and territories, merging the World Health Organization daily case reports with other measures such as population density and country income levels for January 21 to May 18, 2020. A score of government policy interventions was created for low, intermediate, high, and very high interventions. The population's mobility patterns at the country level were obtained from Google community mobility reports. The prospective space–time scan statistic method was applied in five time periods between January and May 2020, and a regression mixed model analysis was used. Results: We found that COVID-19 emerging clusters within these five periods of time increased from 7 emerging clusters to 28 by mid-May 2020. We also detected various increasing and decreasing relative risk estimates of COVID-19 spread among Latin American, Caribbean, and African countries within the period of analysis. Globally, population mobility to parks and similar leisure areas during at least a minimum of implemented intermediate-level control policies (when compared to low-level control policies) was related to accelerated COVID-19 spread. Results were almost consistent when regional stratified analysis was applied. In addition, worldwide population mobility due to working during high implemented control policies and very high implemented control policies, when compared to low-level control policies, was related to positive COVID-19 spread. Conclusions: The prospective space–time scan is an approach that low-income and middle-income countries could use to detect emerging clusters in a timely manner and implement specific control policies and interventions to slow down COVID-19 transmission. In addition, real-time population mobility obtained from crowdsourced digital data could be useful for current and future targeted public health and mitigation policies at a global and regional level.},

abstract = {The emergence of smart cities aims at mitigating the challenges raised due to the continuous urbanization development and increasing population density in cities. To face these challenges, governments and decision makers undertake smart city projects targeting sustainable economic growth and better quality of life for both inhabitants and visitors. Information and Communication Technology (ICT) is a key enabling technology for city smartening. However, ICT artifacts and applications yield massive volumes of data known as big data. Extracting insights and hidden correlations from big data is a growing trend in information systems to provide better services to citizens and support the decision making processes. However, to extract valuable insights for developing city level smart information services, the generated datasets from various city domains need to be integrated and analyzed. This process usually referred to as big data analytics or big data value chain. Surveying the literature reveals an increasing interest in harnessing big data analytics applications in general and in the area of smart cities in particular. Yet, comprehensive discussions on the essential characteristics of big data analytics frameworks fitting smart cities requirements are still needed. This paper presents a novel big data analytics framework for smart cities called “Smart City Data Analytics Panel — SCDAP”. The design of SCDAP is based on answering the following research questions: what are the characteristics of big data analytics frameworks applied in smart cities in literature and what are the essential design principles that should guide the design of big data analytics frameworks have to serve smart cities purposes? In answering these questions, we adopted a systematic literature review on big data analytics frameworks in smart cities. The proposed framework introduces new functionalities to big data analytics frameworks represented in data model management and aggregation. The value of the proposed framework is discussed in comparison to traditional knowledge discovery approaches.},

The serviceability performance constraint ensures acceptable safety level against first plastic hinge occurrence, while the ultimate performance constraint ensures adequate safety against plastic collapse. The multicriteria reliability-based optimization problem with unserviceability and collapse as the failure criteria is presented for different optimum design formulations. The optimization is performed by using the feasible directions method. It is concluded that multicriteria reliability-based optimization has substantial potential for application in optimal design of structural systems. {\textcopyright} 1985.},

Most existing algorithms focus on the geometric and topological relationships of the road network, while did not make full use of the historical road network information and floating car data. In this study, the authors proposed a deep learning enabled vehicle trajectory map-matching method with advanced spatial-temporal analysis (DST-MM). The algorithm mainly focused on the following three aspects: (i) analyse the spatial relevancy from the prospective of geometric analysis, topology analysis and intersection analysis; (ii) to make full use of the historical and real-time data, a deep learning model was conducted to extract the road network and vehicle trajectory features and (iii) establish a speed prediction model and nest it in the temporal analysis structure. It narrows down the path search range through establishing the dynamic candidate graph. Experimental results show that the proposed DST-MM algorithm outperforms the existing algorithms in terms of matching accuracy for low-sampling frequencies GPS data, especially in the central urban area.},

They make it easier for designers to explore conceptual alternatives, but the amount of information generated during a design session can become very large. Intelligent navigation aids are needed to enable designers to access the information with ease and low cognitive loads. We present an approach to support navigation in generative design systems. Our approach takes account of studies related to navigation in physical environ- ments as well as information navigation in electronic media. Results of studies from the physical environment and electronic media reveal that 1) people exhibit similar cognitive behaviors (spatial cognition and the use of spatial knowledge) while navigating in physical and information spaces; and 2) the information space lacks legibility and imageability. The proposed information navigation model takes these findings into account.},

abstract = {Vehicular velocity prediction is of great significance to intelligent transportation system, as it provides a possible future velocity sequence for vehicle's decision-making system. A velocity prediction method via meta learning is proposed, which provides an adaptive and generative framework for multiple-driving cycles. The prediction model is devised using a deep neural network structure. The model's training is performed by the recently proposed meta-supervised learning, which ensures that one trained model could meet the adaptability to multiple driving cycles. The complete framework consists of three parts: Pre-training, fine-tune-training and real-time prediction, which is tested to predict the hybrid electric city buses' future velocity in a variable traffic scenario. The average prediction accuracy of 3, 5 and 10 s horizons is 0.51, 0.63 and 0.88 m s−1, which is 25.9%, 16.78% and 7.47% higher than that trained by the conventional supervised learning method. As suggested, the proposed prediction method is effective and could meet the requirement of energy-saving control for hybrid electric city buses. With further study, potential application of this method may also exist in the field of driving behaviour prediction and transportation mode recognition.},

While there has been an increasing interest in the use of GAs in architecture, there has not yet been a systematic study of the operation of GAs and their application in architecture yet. This paper investigates whether the utilization of GAs is a necessity or a trend; whether GAs are used to accommodate specific needs of architecture or merely to bear innovative and complex forms; and consequently whether GAs serve reality or utopia. In order to answer these questions, the paper examines the operation of GAs in other disciplines and in architecture as well as the implications of its applications in architecture. Finally, the paper demonstrates the premises for a successful operation of GAs in architecture.},

First, it may not have enough bars connecting certain sets of nodes. That is, it may faij for topological reasons. Secondly,. although it may “count” correctly, it may still fail to be rigid if it is set up with some special relative positions of its nodes and bars; This second type of failure is a question not of topology but of projective geometry.},

abstract = {Many studies have tried to use the surrogate safety measures (SSM) estimated from the microscopic traffic simulations. However, it is difficult to adopt these developed SSM to reflect real-world traffic conditions when the developed network in the simulation is not calibrated and validated accordingly. This paper proposed a method to develop the pattern-based surrogate safety measure (PSSM) using individual vehicle trajectory data. The PSSM can be estimated based on the pattern of hazardous driving behaviour (HDB). Using digital tacho graph data collected from the commercial vehicles, HDB patterns were obtained. Various PSSMs were developed and validated with the observed crash data using Random Forest. Then, the surrogate safety performance function was estimated based on the frequency of HDB. To enhance model performance, machine learning and data mining techniques were applied. The results show that sudden deceleration, sudden lane change, sudden overtaking and sudden U-turn are related to traffic crashes during HDB. The results also show that high potential for safety improvement was identified in the road section linking the urban and suburban areas. The findings from this study can provide new approach to adopt real-time individual vehicle trajectory data to evaluate safety performance of network levels.},

abstract = {Urban road intersection bottleneck has become an important factor in causing traffic delay and restricting traffic efficiency. It is essential to explore the prediction of the operating performance at intersections in real-time and formulate corresponding strategies to alleviate intersection delay. However, because of the sophisticated intersection traffic condition, it is difficult to capture the intersection traffic Spatio-temporal features by the traditional data and prediction methods. The development of big data technology and the deep learning model provides us a good chance to address this challenge. Therefore, this paper proposes a multi-task fusion deep learning (MFDL) model based on massive floating car data to effectively predict the passing time and speed at intersections over different estimation time granularity. Moreover, the grid model and the fuzzy C-means (FCM) clustering method are developed to identify the intersection area and derive a set of key Spatio-temporal traffic parameters from floating car data. In order to validate the effectiveness of the proposed model, the floating car data from ten intersections of Beijing with a sampling rate of 3s are adopted for the training and test process. The experiment result shows that the MFDL model ena-bles us to capture the Spatio-temporal and topology feature of the traffic state efficiently. Compared with the traditional prediction method, the proposed model has the best prediction performance. The interplay between these two targeted prediction variables can significantly improve prediction accuracy and efficiency. Thereby, this method predicts the intersection operation performance in real-time and can provide valuable insights for traffic managers to improve the intersection's operation efficiency.},

abstract = {In this paper we propose softBIM, a working method developed through experiences from UNStudio's architectural practice. softBIM is the adherence to BIM processes through the use of code-based interfaces and bespoke—as opposed to standard—solutions, drawing on environments that may be thought of as open-ended, such as commonly accessible CAD platforms. We present examples from practice in which our definition of the softBIM method has been used to some extent. We discuss its advantages and disadvantages in relation to its use in early project phases. The premise for this study is twofold; it has been our intention both to revise the way in which our tools are used, arriving at the back-end programming level in an attempt to increase effectiveness, as well as to devise a specific open-source-type methodology drawing on the above philosophy in a specific way inherent to the UNStudio existing software culture. The goal of this study is to propose an integrative, schematic, and open-ended model for dealing with complex assemblies of geometric and nongeometric project data, aiming to remain nonreliant on specific software packages.},

The first experiment involved resources of the Paracloud program and its relation with the Rhinoceros program, that resulted in the production of physical models produced with the aid of the laser cutting. In the second experiment, the students had produced algorithms in the Grasshopper, resulting in families of structures and coverings. The study objects are both the physical models and digital algorithms resultants from this experimentation. For the analysis and synthesis of the results, we adopted four important assumptions: 1. the value of attitudes and environment of work; 2. the importance of experimentation and improvisation; 3. understanding of the design process as a situated act and as a ill-defined problem; 4. the inclusion of creative and critical thought in the disciplines. The results allow us to affirm that the parametric modeling stimulates creativity, therefore allowing combination of different parameters, that result in unexpected discoveries.\r\nKeywords: Teach-Learning, Parametric Modeling, Laser Cutter, Grasshopper, Design Process, Creativity.},

abstract = {The shear behavior of micro-scale truss structures formed from a three-dimensional interconnected pattern of self-propagating polymer waveguides was investigated. These structures had sub-millimeter size features and comprised a repeating octahedral-type unit cell designed to suppress bending in the truss members prior to initial failure. For a typical shear loading method, the experimentally measured shear moduli deviated from predicted values as the relative density decreased. However, the mechanical behavior changed when the shear loading condition was altered to distribute the load more uniformly between all truss members and the measured shear modulus was aligned with predicted values. The shear strength and total plateau strain of these structures were strongly dependent on the mode of failure and the uniformity with which the truss member failure was distributed through the thickness of the structure. Furthermore, plateau strains of up to 60% were achieved when all truss members in compression buckled uniformly. Thermo-oxidation reaction of the polymer micro-truss structures caused an increase in the shear modulus and maximum shear strength (up to 2.9MPa), although oxidized structures fractured at the maximum shear strain.},

abstract = {Short-term traffic flow forecasting is a key element in Intelligent Transport Systems (ITS) to provide proactive traffic state information to road network operators. A variety of methods to predict traffic variables in the short-term can be found in the literature, ranging from time-series algorithms, machine learning tools and deep learning methods to a selective hybrid of these approaches. Despite the advances in prediction techniques, a challenging problem that affects the application of such methods in the real world is the prevalence of insufficient data across an entire network. It is rare that extensive historical training data required for model training are available for all the links in a city. In order to address this data insufficiency problem, this paper applies transfer learning techniques to machine learning methods in short-term traffic prediction. All the traffic data used in this paper were collected from Highways England road networks in the UK. The results show that through improving the transferability of machine learning-based models, the computational burden due to the model training process can be significantly reduced and the prediction accuracy under data deficient scenarios can be improved for one-step ahead prediction. However, the prediction accuracy gradually decreases in multi-step ahead prediction. It is also found that the accuracy of the proposed hybrid method is highly dependent upon consistency between datasets but less dependent on geographical attributes of links.},

abstract = {A construction tree is a set of shape generation processes commonly produced with CAD modelers during a design process of B-Rep objects. However, a construction tree does not bring all the desired properties in many configurations: dimension modifications, idealization processes, etc. Generating a non trivial set of generative processes, possibly forming a construction graph, can significantly improve the adequacy of some of these generative processes to meet user's application needs. This paper proposes to extract generative processes from a given B-rep shape as a high-level shape description. To evaluate the usefulness of this description, finite element analyses (FEA) and particularly idealizations are the applications selected to evaluate the adequacy of additive generative processes. Non trivial construction trees containing generic extrusion and revolution primitives behave like well established CSG trees. Advantageously, the proposed approach is primitive-based, which ensures that any generative process of the construction graph does preserve the realizability of the corresponding volume. In the context of FEA, connections between idealized primitives of a construction graph can be efficiently performed using their interfaces. Consequently, generative processes of a construction graph become a high-level object structure that can be tailored to idealizations of primitives and robust connections between them.},

abstract = {Porous thin films are the main candidates to achieve Ultra Low K materials for interlayer dielectric (ILD) applications, but their mechanical properties remain low. Indeed, the introduction of porosity significantly decreases the dielectric constant $\kappa$, but also affects the mechanical properties. However, both mechanical and dielectric performances are influenced by the pore arrangement and geometry that can thus be optimized for these two antagonist properties. A Finite Element study is conducted to quantify the influence of the arrangement and the geometry of the pores via a homogenization approach. The best architectures for ILD applications are deduced. Random arrangements as well as 3D cubic arrangements (simple, body-centered, face-centered) of monodisperse spherical pores have been considered. These arrangements are obtainable by sol-gel processing, a method that often induces a marked shrinkage of the films. This shrinkage modifies the original cubic arrangements which become orthorhombic and the pore shape which becomes ellipsoidal. The effect on the dielectric and elastic properties of these architectural changes due to the shrinkage has also been studied. {\textcopyright} 2011 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract = {This paper describes an on-road air quality monitoring and control approach by proposing an agent-based system for modeling the urban road network infrastructure, establishing the real-time and predicted air pollution indexes in different road segments and generating recommendations and regulation proposals for road users. This can help by reducing vehicle emissions in the most polluted road sections, optimizing the pollution levels while maximizing the vehicle flow. For this, we use data sets gathered from a set of air quality monitoring stations, embedded low-cost e-participatory pollution sensors, contextual data, and the road network available data. These data are used in the air quality indexes calculation and then the generation of a dynamic traffic network. This network is represented by a weighted graph in which the edges weights evolve according to the pollution indexes. In this paper, we propose to combine the benefits of agent technology with both machine learning and big data tools. An artificial neural networks model and the Dijkstra algorithm are used for air quality prediction and the least polluted path finding in the road network. All data processing tasks are performed over a Hadoop-based framework: HBase and MapReduce.},

Differentiation is introduced as a key design strategy of PDT and is demonstrated through classification of prominent case studies.},

abstract = {Accurate and real-time traffic passenger flows forecasting at transportation hubs, such as subway/bus stations, is a practical application and of great significance for urban traffic planning, control, guidance, etc. Recently deep learning based methods are promised to learn the spatial-temporal features from high non-linearity and complexity of traffic flows. However, it is still very challenging to handle so much complex factors including the urban transportation network topological structures and the laws of traffic flows with spatial and temporal dependencies. Considering both the static hybrid urban transportation network structures and dynamic spatial-temporal relationships among stations from historical traffic passenger flows, a more effective and fine-grained spatial-temporal features learning framework is necessary. In this paper, we propose a novel spatial-temporal incidence dynamic graph neural networks framework for urban traffic passenger flows prediction. We first model dynamic traffic station relationships over time as spatial-temporal incidence dynamic graph structures based on historically traffic passenger flows. Then we design a novel dynamic graph recurrent convolutional neural network, namely Dynamic-GRCNN, to learn the spatial-temporal features representation for urban transportation network topological structures and transportation hubs. To fully utilize the historical passenger flows, we sample the short-term, medium-term and long-term historical traffic data in training, which can capture the periodicity and trend of the traffic passenger flows at different stations. We conduct extensive experiments on different types of traffic passenger flows datasets including subway, taxi and bus flows in Beijing. The results show that the proposed Dynamic-GRCNN effectively captures comprehensive spatial-temporal correlations significantly and outperforms both traditional and deep learning based urban traffic passenger flows prediction methods.},

One RNN encodes a sequence of symbols into a fixedlength vector representation, and the other decodes the representation into another sequence of symbols. The encoder and decoder of the proposed model are jointly trained to maximize the conditional probability of a target sequence given a source sequence. The performance of a statistical machine translation system is empirically found to improve by using the conditional probabilities of phrase pairs computed by the RNN Encoder-Decoder as an additional feature in the existing log-linear model. Qualitatively, we show that the proposed model learns a semantically and syntactically meaningful representation of linguistic phrases.},

abstract = {Computers have now become a crucial component in the process of digital media contents creation. Computer programs have been written to generate artistic artifacts, for examples, poetry, painting and music. These artifacts could be classified along the spectrum of algorithmic complexity of the programs, where order is at one end and disorder is at the other end. The artifacts classified toward the order end of the spectrum possess a clear structure (e.g., symmetry and tiling) while the artifacts classified toward the disorder end do not have any structure at both local and global levels (e.g., randomisation). Highly ordered or disordered generative art artifacts are generated from efficient algorithms that are simpler than those used to generate artifacts classified as lying between the order and disorder extremes. Control is embedded in the programs and it expresses the intention and strategy of the creative process. In this paper, we investigate the issue of control in generative art. We argue that the control expressed in the programs is a crucial component in a generative process. Hence, the ability to exert control is important in guiding the creative processes to intentionally generate complex and interesting artifacts. We describe the nature of the control observed in the generative process of computer generative art techniques. We then present examples of computer generated painting and discuss the control employed in the generative processes. ?? 2012 Published by Elsevier B.V.},

abstract = {In an effort to remedy the issue of stagnant labor productivity in the construction industry, Building Information Modeling was proposed in the late 80's as a new solution for streamlining the design and delivery process of construction projects. BIM is a digital representation of a building meant to serve all project participants as a repository of all relevant data throughout the project's lifecycle. Management of this data along with the collaborative nature of BIM has been shown to offer many potential benefits to those involved in the project. Despite the huge potential for increasing productivity as well as the overall efficiency of construction projects, the adoption of BIM throughout the industry has been observed as slower than expected. This paper explores and analyzes the various barriers hindering the widespread adoption of BIM throughout the industry as well as proposes methods for addressing them. The author then answers the question of who should be responsible for driving the adoption of BIM and how to effectively do it. Finally the author proposes areas of further research and development which will assist in achieving a more widespread adoption of BIM throughout the industry.},

abstract = {Understanding and predicting cellular traffic at large-scale and fine-granularity is beneficial and valuable to mobile users, wireless carriers and city authorities. Predicting cellular traffic in modern metropolis is particularly challenging because of the tremendous temporal and spatial dynamics introduced by diverse user Internet behaviours and frequent user mobility citywide. In this paper, we characterize and investigate the root causes of such dynamics in cellular traffic through a big cellular usage dataset covering 1.5 million users and 5,929 cell towers in a major city of China. We reveal intensive spatiotemporal dependency even among distant cell towers, which is largely overlooked in previous works. To explicitly characterize and effectively model the spatio-temporal dependency of urban cellular traffic, we propose a novel decomposition of in-cell and inter-cell data traffic, and apply a graph-based deep learning approach to accurate cellular traffic prediction. Experimental results demonstrate that our method consistently outperforms the state-of-the-art time-series based approaches and we also show through an example study how the decomposition of cellular traffic can be used for event inference.},

abstract = {Much interest has been recently devoted to generative processes in design. Advances in computational tools for design applications, coupled with techniques from the field of artificial intelligence, have lead to new possibilities in the way computers can inform and actively interact with the design process. In this paper, we use the concepts of generative and goal-oriented design to propose a computer tool that can help the designer to generate and evaluate certain aspects of a solution towards an optimized behavior of the final configuration. This work focuses mostly on those aspects related to the environmental performance of buildings. Genetic Algorithms (GAs) are applied as a generative and search procedure to look for optimized design solutions in terms of thermal and lighting performance in a building. The GA is first used to generate possible design solutions, which are then evaluated in terms of lighting and thermal behavior using a detailed thermal analysis program (DOE2.1E). The results from the simulations are subsequently used to further guide the GA search towards finding low-energy solutions to the problem under study. Solutions can be visualized using an AutoLisp routine. The specific problem addressed in this study is the placing and sizing of windows in an office building. The same method is applicable to a wide range of design problems like the choice of construction materials, design of shading elements, or sizing of lighting and mechanical systems for buildings. ?? 2002 Elsevier Science B.V.

abstract = {Generative Architectural Design permits the automatic (or semiautomatic) generation of architectural objects for a wide range of applications, from archaeological research and reconstruction to digital sketching. In this paper the authors introduce design constraint systems (DCS), their approach to the generation of architectural design with the help of a simple example: The development of the necessary formalisms to generate a family of architectural designs, i.e. simple houses and pagodas. After explaining the formal system the authors introduce an approach for the generation of complex form based on the application of transformations and distortions. Architecture is bound by the constraints of physical reality: Gravitation and the properties of the used materials define the limits in which architectural design is possible. With the recent development of new materials and construction methods however, the ways in which form and physics go together get more complicated. As a result, the shapes of architecture gain more liberty, and more and more complex shapes and structures become possible. While these advances allow for new ways of architectural expression, they also make the design process much more challenging. For this reason new tools are necessary for making this complexity manageable for the architect and enable her to play and experiment with the new possibilities of complex shapes and structures. Design constraint systems can be used as tool for experimentation with complex form. Therefore, the authors dedicate the final part of this paper to a concise delineation of an approach for the generation of complex and irregular shapes and structures. While the examples used are simple, they give an idea of the generality of design constraint systems: By using a two-component approach to the generation of designs (the first component describes the abstract structure of the modelled objects while the second component interprets the structure and generates the actual geometric forms) and allowing the user to adjust both components freely, it can be adapted to all kind of different architectural styles, from historical to contemporary architecture.},

In the last years, a number of case studies have been published both for demonstrating the various applications of 4D and for assessing technological propositions. However, in most papers only little place is given to the particular content of 4D models. In parallel, following the growing implementation of Building Information Modeling, 4D modeling process is usually recognized as a “BIM use”. In BIM implementations and protocols, the Level Of Development of datasets is a fundamental issue. This paper describes the application of two distinct “4D uses” conducted on a single pilot project. They aim to assess the levels of graphical and temporal details required for the implemented uses. The authors finally discuss the diversity of 4D uses with 4D models, both planned or ad-hoc, as well as the logical understanding related to 4D LOD.},

abstract = {The article explores the nature of architectural invention in Indian sacred structures by analyzing a group of eleventh-century sandstone temples in the Karnataka region of southern India. Identifying a variety of experiments in a closely related group, it refutes a commonly held scholarly assumption that Indian temples follow architectural norms ordained by India's religious traditions-an assumption fed by Western definitions of individuality and originality. These Karnataka temples demonstrate that their architects-while mostly unknown-fundamentally changed the formal as well as the conceptual basis of southern architecture they had inherited. Their formal choices, manipulating regional conventions as well as opening up their structures to include references from other regions, led to a new, consciously modern form of architecture whose modernity has been overlooked by scholars. Scholars have tended to call this new regional invention Vesara (Sanskrit "mule" or "hybrid"), defining it as a derivative style of temple created by mixing typical features of North Indian and South Indian architecture. The article traces the emergence of Vesara's conceptual logic in the eleventh century through architectural anomalies and daringly unprecedented play with the formal means of regional architecture, arguing that the makers of these temples exercised a level of inventiveness we have not been willing to credit them with so far.},

Connected car-sharing systems, as the promising appliance of connected cars, provide a convenient transportation mode for citizens' intra-urban commutes. Determining the locations of depots is the primary job in connected car-sharing systems. Existing methods mainly use qualitative method and do not consider spatial–temporal dynamic travel demands. This article proposes a mobile edge computing–based connected car framework which uses normal taxis as connected cars to describe their Global Positioning System trajectory and perform the computing tasks in each mobile edge computing server independently. A spatial–temporal demand coverage approach is developed to optimize the location of depots. This article proposes a deep learning method to predict car-sharing demand constructed by a stacked auto-encoder model and a logistic regression layer. The stacked auto-encoder model is employed for learning the latent spatial and temporal correlation features of demand. A graph-based resource relocation model is proposed to minimize the cost of relocation considering spatio-temporal variation of car-sharing demand. Experiments performed on the large-scale real-world data sets illustrate that our proposed model has superior performance than existing methods.},

abstract = {Parametric modelling software often maintains an explicit history of design development in the form of a graph. However, as the graph increases in complexity it quickly becomes inflexible and unsuitable for exploring a wide design space. By contrast, implicit low-level rule systems can offer wide design exploration due to their lack of structure, but often act as black boxes to human observers with only initial conditions and final designs cognisable. In response to these two extremes, the authors propose a new approach called Meta-Parametric Design, combining graph-based parametric modelling with genetic programming. The advantages of this approach are demonstrated using two real case-study projects that widen design exploration whilst maintaining the benefits of a graph representation.},

abstract = {21st century is a synonym for change in all aspects of life and economic activities. Accelerating change is caused by development of new technologies that radically change how humans communicate and cooperate. On average, formal education in comparison with other economic sectors is lagging behind in adoption of contemporary technologies in educational processes. One of the biggest potential impact that will radically change the landscape of education is implementation of artificial intelligence. That radical change makes artificial intelligence disruptive technology with unforeseen consequences for students, faculty and society in general. The bottom line is that educational system will be forced to adopt to new technologies, abandoning traditional teaching and pedagogical practices that were in the center of education for centuries. This paper gives a short overview of disruptive innovations and technologies with the focus on artificial intelligence as a disruptive technology. Special focus is given to the limits and obstacles of introduction of artificial intelligence in educational processes and educational system in general.},

abstract = {With the rapid development of information technology at the beginning of the 21st century, the traditional transportation system is rapidly transforming to Intelligent Transportation System (ITS). Meanwhile, as a powerful optimization tool for the applications' performance under the framework of ITS, the traffic prediction model has gained much attention. The traffic prediction model belongs to the traditional time series prediction model, widely used in industry for business analysis, abnormalities detection, etc. There are two main categories of traffic prediction models — the parametric model and the non-parametric model. The non-parametric model develops rapidly in recent years due to the machine learning theory's maturing and increment in computing power. Compared to the parametric model, the non-parametric model is more accurate and requires less advanced analysis of traffic patterns' correlation, and can better handle a large amount of historical data. However, the non-parametric model also requires more powerful devices for training and implementation. The traffic prediction system's implementation environment, built by on-road resources and off-road infrastructures, is relatively limited compared to the traditional data center. This paper uses several well-known state-of-the-art non-parametric models and their Deep Learning structures for traffic prediction, and evaluates the models' performance on both freeway and urban-road dataset. Focusing on the model's accuracy and training cost while deploying prediction models in a large-scale traffic network, this paper provides a novel optimized training strategy called CTS to reduce the implementation cost of a complex inner structure model. This approach could be further used to reduce the deployment cost, especially the training time, for the big data intelligent system using machine learning.},

abstract = {Context: Modern middleware platforms provide the applications deployed on top of them with facilities for their adaptation. However, the level of adaptation support provided by the state-of-the-art middleware solutions is often limited to dynamically loading and off-loading of software components. Therefore, it is left to the application developers to handle the details of change such that the system's consistency is not jeopardized. Objective: We aim to change the status quo by providing the middleware facilities necessary to ensure the consistency of software after adaptation. We would like these facilities to be reusable across different applications, such that the middleware can streamline the process of achieving safe adaptation. Method: Our approach addresses the current shortcomings by utilizing the information encoded in a software system's architectural style. This information drives the development of reusable adaptation patterns. The patterns specify both the exact sequence of changes and the time at which those changes need to occur. We use the patterns to provide advanced adaptation support on top of an existing architectural middleware platform. Results: Our experience shows the feasibility of deriving detailed adaptation patterns for several architectural styles. Applying the middleware to adapt two real-world software systems shows the approach is effective in consistently adapting these systems without jeopardizing their consistency. Conclusion: We conclude the approach is effective in alleviating the application developers from the responsibility of managing the adaptation process at the application-level. Moreover, we believe this study provides the foundation for changing the way adaptation support is realized in middleware solutions. ?? 2012 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

Lisbona, Fourier analysis for multigrid methods on triangular grids, SIAM J. Sci. Comput., in press], a Local Fourier Analysis (LFA) for multigrid methods with standard coarsening on triangular grids has been proposed. It is based on an expression of the Fourier transform in new coordinate systems. LFA is applied to the new coarsening strategy to design components for an efficient multigrid algorithm. The definition of low and high frequencies, and therefore the spaces of harmonics, are adapted according to the new situation. Appropriate smoothing methods, in particular a three-color smoother with optimal relaxation parameter, are proposed and analyzed for the discrete Laplace operator obtained with linear finite elements. Moreover, special inter-grid transfer operators are designed. These methods are compared with standard coarsening algorithms in terms of the computational work required. Independently of the shape of the triangles, we show that the three-coarsening strategy is a good computational alternative to standard coarsening.},

abstract = {There is a growing consensus that 3D printing technologies will be one of the next major technological revolutions. While a lot of work has already been carried out as to what these technologies will bring in terms of product and process innovation, little has been done on their impact on business models and business model innovation. Yet, history has shown that technological revolution without adequate business model evolution is a pitfall for many businesses. In the case of 3D printing, the matter is further complicated by the fact that adoption of these technologies has occurred in four successive phases (rapid prototyping, rapid tooling, digital manufacturing, home fabrication) that correspond to a different level of involvement of 3D printing in the production process. This article investigates the effect of each phase on the key business model components. While the impact of rapid prototyping and rapid tooling is found to be limited in extent, direct manufacturing and, even more so, home fabrication have the potential to be highly disruptive. While much more value can be created, capturing value can become extremely challenging. Hence, finding a suitable business model is critical. To this respect, this article shows that 3D printing technologies have the potential to change the way business model innovation is carried out, by enabling adaptive business models and by bringing the ‘rapid prototyping' paradigm to business model innovation itself.},

abstract = {In extremely hot and dry climates, like northwestern Mexico, solar gain reduction in houses using solar passive techniques is important for improving comfort inside the construction and to save costs in electrical cooling during the whole year, because the winter season is also hot in those regions. A new one-dimension method is proposed to analyze the interaction between two common shading devices: awnings and external walls to reduce insulation on the facade and inside the house due to fenestration. The method is demonstrated by optimizing a typical dwelling with an azimuth of 90° (east), which, achieves 45% reduction in direct solar insulation during the summer solstice on the profile of the facade. Results showed that this method is simple and reliable in increasing the shadow on the facade and to block completely the solar beam radiation on the windowpane with optimal relations between these shading devices. {\textcopyright} 2002 Elsevier Science Ltd.

abstract = {The aim of this article is to reflect on the use of the parametric modeling in two didactic experiences. The first experiment involved resources of the Paracloud program and its relation with the Rhinoceros program, that resulted in the production of physical models produced with the aid of the laser cutting. In the second experiment, the students had produced algorithms in the Grasshopper, resulting in families of structures and coverings. The study objects are both the physical models and digital algorithms resultants from this experimentation. For the analysis and synthesis of the results, we adopted four important assumptions: 1. the value of attitudes and environment of work; 2. the importance of experimentation and improvisation; 3. understanding of the design process as a situated act and as a ill-defined problem; 4. the inclusion of creative and critical thought in the disciplines. The results allow us to affirm that the parametric modeling stimulates creativity, therefore allowing combination of different parameters, that result in unexpected discoveries.\r\nKeywords: Teach-Learning, Parametric Modeling, Laser Cutter, Grasshopper, Design Process, Creativity.},

abstract = {We applied the DCCA multiple cross-correlation coefficient to analyze time series of EEG experiment, where 109 subjects performed four tasks involving real and imaginary motor activities. In this case, four specific channels were selected on the scalp: two on the frontal and two on parietal region. As a result, the DCCA multiple cross-correlation coefficient identified that there is a single signature for each subject. Globally, there is no significant difference between the real and the imaginary task. The frontal channels had greater multiple cross-correlation values than the parietal ones, especially for time scales around 0.42s, and with smaller standard deviations. According to our results, the proposal to study multiple time series at the same time by using the DCCA multiple cross-correlation coefficient is feasible and robust for EEG analysis. Finally, the coefficient was applied in a substantial number of subjects, tasks, and experiments producing high-quality results (figures, movies, and tables), and this study will probably kick off of a new approach to analyzing multiple cross-correlations in EEG signals.}

abstract = {Both sub-prime and Eurozone debt crisis problems caused severe financial crisis, which affected European markets in general, but particularly the banking sector. The continuous devaluation of bank shares in the financial sector caused a great decrease in market capitalization, and in citizen and investor confidence. Panic among investors led them to sell shares, while other agents took the opportunity to buy them. Therefore, the study of bank shares is important, particularly of their efficiency. In this paper, adopting a sliding windows detrended fluctuation approach, we analyse the efficiency concept dynamically with 63 European banks (both in and outside the Eurozone). The main results show that the crisis had an effect on changing the efficiency pattern.},

Then, combining the two matrices with the method of random matrix theory (RMT), we mainly investigate the statistical properties of cross-correlations in the US stock market. We choose the daily closing prices of 462 constituent stocks of S\&P 500 index as the research objects and select the sample data from January 3, 2005 to August 31, 2012. In the empirical analysis, we examine the statistical properties of cross-correlation coefficients, the distribution of eigenvalues, the distribution of eigenvector components, and the inverse participation ratio. From the two methods, we find some new results of the cross-correlations in the US stock market in our study, which are different from the conclusions reached by previous studies. The empirical cross-correlation matrices constructed by the DCCA coefficient show several interesting properties at different time scales in the US stock market, which are useful to the risk management and optimal portfolio selection, especially to the diversity of the asset portfolio. It will be an interesting and meaningful work to find the theoretical eigenvalue distribution of a completely random matrix R for the DCCA coefficient because it does not obey the Mar{\v c}enko-Pastur distribution. {\copyright} 2013 Elsevier B.V.

  abstract = {EEG is one of the techniques more used to assess the extent of damage from these deficiencies and even to find solutions such as rehabilitation or limb replacement using a bionic prosthesis, through brain-computer interface. That is why it is of vital importance that we understand the functioning of the primary motor cortex of the brain in the control of real/imaginary tasks. From Physionet database, with two-minute EEG recordings in three different experiments (real/imaginary), we applied DFA and DCCA methods to find auto-correlations and cross-correlations. DFA method was capable of quantitatively describing similarities when the brain performs the same motor task, and show there are three time-scales. After, in order to compare the fluctuation amplitude of an EEG signal in relation to the other channels and measure these cross-correlations, we applied ∆ log FDFA function and ρDCCA coefficient. Thus, choosing the F3 channel (front) as the reference, we identified generally that: ∆ log FDFA[F3 : xx] ≥ 0 and ρDCCA {$>$} 0. The channels: Cz , F6, T9, and T10, are those that have a higher level of DCCA cross-correlation, if compared to the channel F3. The time scale II, with 16 {$<$} n ≤ 723, is the one with ρDCCA maximum. Finally, the statistic applied in this paper, based on the DFA-method, proved to be an excellent candidate for studies of motor functions in the brain computer interface area.},

abstract = {In this paper, a new coefficient is proposed with the objective of quantifying the level of cross-correlation between nonstationary time series. This cross-correlation coefficient is defined in terms of the DFA method and the DCCA method. The implementation of this cross-correlation coefficient will be illustrated with selected time series. {\textcopyright} 2010 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

@article{Podobnik2008,
abstract = {Here we propose a new method, detrended cross-correlation analysis, which is a generalization of detrended fluctuation analysis and is based on detrended covariance. This method is designed to investigate power-law cross correlations between different simultaneously recorded time series in the presence of nonstationarity. We illustrate the method by selected examples from physics, physiology, and finance. {\textcopyright} 2008 The American Physical Society.},
